The views expressed here are those of the authors and should not \nbe attributed to their respective institutions. This work has been supported by the World Bank\u2019s Strategic Impact \nEvaluation Fund (SIEF).  \n\n2 \n \nI. Introduction \nInvestments that occur during children\u2019s early years are critical for determining their entire \ntrajectory of human capital accumulation, including their education, physical and mental health, and \nearnings as adults (Almond and Currie, 2011; Bailey et al, 2021; Gertler et al, 2014; and Walker et al, \n2022). Likewise, early deficits in child development tend to persist or even amplify as children age and \nenter school (Hamadani et al, 2014 and Schady et al, 2015). In a number of small-scale trials across \nmultiple countries, home visiting programs have demonstrated potential for tackling early deficits in \nchildren\u2019s cognitive, language, motor, and social-emotional skills (Jensen et al, 2021; Jeong et al, 2021; \nand Jervis et al, 2023).  \nLittle is known, however, about the costs of these programs in which trained staff make frequent \ndoor-to-door visits to counsel parents of young children and demonstrate how they can incorporate \ncognitive and social-emotional stimulation activities for children into their daily routines and reduce the \nuse of harsh methods for discipline. Studies that report costs rarely document their estimation methods or \ndata sources, and estimates suggest a wide range, with weekly home visiting programs costing from USD \n12 per child per month in India (Grantham-McGregor et al., 2020) to approximately USD 160 per child \nper month in Rwanda (Desmond, 2019).  \nThis study estimates the costs for a state-run home visiting program in Cear\u00e1, Brazil \u2013 the \nPrograma de Apoio ao Desenvolvimento Infantil (PADIN, or Child Development Support Program in \nEnglish) \u2013 implemented by the state\u2019s Department of Education. Obtaining accurate cost estimates for a \ndecentralized program like PADIN in which the state designs a program and provides fixed per-capita \nfunding for municipalities to implement is particularly challenging, as cost data collection must occur at \nboth the central and decentralized levels. Using an ingredients-based approach for measuring all \ncomponents of a program\u2019s costs (Levin et.al, 2018), we use administrative data, survey data, GIS data, \nand interviews to estimate total annual costs per child, the degree of cost sharing between the state \ngovernment and municipal governments, and breakdowns by expenditure category. The ingredients-based \napproach requires us to capture all the quantities and prices for each input or resources used to implement \nthe program, in contrast to approaches that start with budgets that are aggregated by very general \ncategories (such as personnel or equipment) and that may not reflect actual expenditures.  Other studies \nhave found substantial differences between this kind of \u201cmicro-costing\u201d approach and those that solely \nrely on aggregated administrative records or reference-based pricing (Frapier et al, 2015; Chorozoglou et \nal, 2023).    \nWe also document the extent of heterogeneity in cost, cost sharing, and determinants of cost \nobserved across municipalities implementing the program.  If implementing jurisdictions must spend a \n\n3 \n \nsignificant amount of their own funds on state programs and if this cost-sharing is not made explicit from \nthe onset, then program sustainability can be jeopardized if municipalities cannot consistently raise \nsufficient funds to implement the program.  Moreover, though per-capita state funding for PADIN is \nequal across municipalities by design, if municipalities can top-up spending, then the program itself can \nwiden pre-existing inequalities across municipalities to the extent that municipalities that spend more on \nthe program also spend more on other investments in young children.   \nWe estimate that the annual cost per child of the biweekly PADIN program, when implemented \nfor 10 months of the year, is BRL 1,597 in 2018 or USD 438.  The top three cost elements are \ncompensation for the home visitors (27 percent of total costs), compensation for state-level personnel \nproviding technical assistance and supervision (23 percent), and compensation for municipal-level \nsupervision (14 percent).  Thus, frontline workers only accounted for less than one-third of the program, \nwhich is consistent with other costing studies that find front-line personnel to account for a third or less of \ncosts in early childhood development programs (Gustafsson-Wright, Boggild-Jones, and Gardiner, 2017).   \nOur results also suggest that though the program had been spearheaded by the state, \nmunicipalities make significant financial contributions to the PADIN program. On average, they bear 38 \npercent of the costs of implementation. There is substantial variation in this cost sharing, ranging from 22 \nto 52 percent of the costs of implementation across all municipalities in the sample. The data required to \nestimate costs also shed light on variation in implementation across municipalities. For example, different \nmunicipalities spend very different amounts on supervision, both because they purchase varying amounts \nof supervisors\u2019 time (ranging from 25 to 100 percent of their total time) and because they compensate \nsupervisors differently (ranging from BRL 700 to BRL 4,575 per month, equivalent to USD 192 to USD \n1,253).   \nFinally, we use the cost data gathered for this analysis to assess the completeness of \nadministrative data for costing purposes and to estimate discrepancies between the costs implied from \nprogram financial records and costs estimated using the ingredients-based approach. Data from the Online \nMonitoring System, for example, could not be used to determine very basic information, such as the \nnumber of home visitors employed in each municipality or the number of families served. Data on these \nindicators were available but deviated unrealistically from program design and what was tracked by \nPADIN personnel and municipal offices. Though transportation accounted for a non-trivial proportion of \ntotal costs (10%), little current administrative source of data could be used to estimate the transportation \ncosts of the home visiting program, as records tended to group them with all transportation-related costs \nincurred by all programs of the municipal Education Secretariats.  Our data from surveys of municipal \nsupervisors suggest that in many cases, transportation costs of the PADIN program are borne by the home \n\n4 \n \nvisitors themselves, as more than half of the surveyed supervisors reported that home visitors in their \nmunicipalities use their own vehicle for commutes without any additional compensation.  \nA comparison of our cost data and the data found in financial records underscores the value of \nusing the ingredients-based method to capture actual resource use. When calculated based solely on \nfinancial records from both state and municipal governments, the unit cost estimate of the program would \nbe 27 percent higher than the estimate obtained through ingredient-based methods and multiple rounds of \ndata validation. An examination of more disaggregated costs indicates this average discrepancy masks the \noccurrence of both cost overestimates and cost underestimates. While financial records implied \ntransportation costs that were 3.9 times higher, they also would have undervalued the cost of supervision \nand frontline workers by 40 percent.    \nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows: The next section provides some background on the \nPADIN program, while Section III describes the multiple sources of data and methods used to estimate \ncosts of the program. Section IV presents our findings on PADIN\u2019s cost structure and cost drivers and \nillustrates the drawbacks in relying on only one data source to estimate costs. Section V concludes.  \nII. The PADIN home visiting program  \n \nStarted and led by the Cear\u00e1 state government since 2017, the PADIN program targets rural \nhouseholds benefitting from the Bolsa Familia cash transfer program that have children under the age of \n47 months. The program uses home visits to improve parental attachment and help below-poverty line \nfamilies create a home environment that fosters language, cognitive, and social emotional skills, as well \nas healthy physical development. College educated home visitors (known as agentes de desenvolvimento \ninfantil (ADIs) or child development agents) visit families twice a month to engage with mothers and \ntheir children in early stimulation activities and to encourage parents to continue trying out these activities \nat home. The families are also invited to participate in community meetings, usually once a month, to \nreinforce messages from the home visits.  \n \nAs a state initiative, PADIN is overseen by the State Secretariat for Education (SEDUC) and \nCenters for Regional Coordination of Education Development (CREDE). These units were responsible \nfor designing the program and its operational framework and overseeing its implementation.  The state \ngovernment transfers funds with a fixed transfer per eligible family meant to cover the compensation for \nthe home visitors and supervisors (compensation for home visitors and supervisors is labeled as \n\u201cscholarships\u201d rather than salaries). The state government also organizes training for the home visitors \nand provides in-kind program assets, such as the learning materials that are used by the home visitors to \ndemonstrate play-based stimulation activities and that are left with families for their use until the next \nvisit.  \n\n5 \n \nOf 184 municipalities in Cear\u00e1, 34 municipalities and 2 districts in the state capital adopted the \nprogram in 2017. In 2018, the program expanded to 48 municipalities (with each district counted as a \nmunicipality). These municipalities all fall into the highest quintile of poverty incidence in the state. \nParticipating municipalities must identify eligible families and recruit supervisors and home visitors. \nThey also must ensure the availability of physical spaces for community meetings and PADIN team \nmeetings and provide technical assistance for planning program activities, monitoring, and evaluation.  \n III. Data and methods \nWe aimed to estimate costs for all 32 municipalities that had adopted PADIN in 2017 and had \nmaintained implementation in 2018,2 using the \u201cingredients method\u201d of Levin et al. (2018) to estimate all \ncosts associated with the PADIN program. Rather than starting with large categories of expenditure, such \nas personnel or travel, and matching these to budgets and expenditures, the ingredients method first \ninvolves making a list of all the activities and resources required to make a program happen (for example, \ntraining of supervisors and home visitors, transport for training, pedagogical kits for families, supervision, \ntransportation for home visits) and then further breaking these into (i) the quantities of inputs that go into \nthe activities and resources (for example, one supervisor working half time for a year) and (ii) the prices \nassociated with these inputs (for example, the salaries of the supervisors). The approach aims to capture \nall resources needed to keep the program running regardless of who is paying. In a program like PADIN, \nnot only would resources potentially come from the state government and participating municipalities, but \ncommunities may also bear some costs if community meetings that require effort from volunteers are \nbuilt into the program.  \nFrom 2018 to 2019, we assembled multiple data sources both to draw up an exhaustive list of \nactivities and resources and to identify the quantities and prices of each input. Because the program was \nimplemented by both the state and individual municipal governments, there was no single source of \ninformation that would capture all activities and resources associated with the program. We had to make \nsite visits to observe the program under implementation, interview state- and municipal-level personnel \nmanaging the program, conduct a survey among municipal officials, and obtain program monitoring data \ncollected separately by the state PADIN team and the state-level Online Monitoring System.  \n \n2 The 32 municipalities in our sample include Amontada, Ararend\u00e1, Barroquinha, Boa Viagem, Capistrano, Chor\u00f3, \nCroat\u00e1, Gra\u00e7a, Granja, Ipueiras, Irau\u00e7uba, Itapi\u00fana, Itarema, Itatira, Martin\u00f3pole, Mira\u00edma, Mora\u00fajo, Morrinhos, \nMucambo, Novo Oriente, Pereiro, Quiterian\u00f3polis, Reriutaba, Salitre, Santana do Acara\u00fa, Santana do Cariri, \nTamboril, Tarrafas, Trairi, Tururu, Uruoca and Vi\u00e7osa do Cear\u00e1. In all exhibits, we labeled municipalities with a \nnumber between 1 and 32 to protect the identity of survey respondents since there were only 1-3 respondents with \nspecific roles per municipality. The raw data provided in the reproducibility package has also been anonymized.  \n\n6 \n \nTable 1 describes the cost structure of the program and indicates which ingredients we did not \ncost.  Just from this structure alone, it is apparent that municipal governments play a large role in \nimplementing the PADIN program and must use some of their own resources for program \nimplementation. There also appears to be considerable leeway for municipalities to spend more on certain \ningredients, such as supervisors\u2019 compensation or transportation. Community costs primarily comprise \nthe time volunteers spend traveling to and assisting in community meetings. The opportunity cost for \nparents to travel to and attend these meetings is negligible, as most are held on weekends. \nWe did not monetize the time of some support personnel in the municipal office, transportation \ncosts for community meetings, or the amortized costs of venues for community meetings and office \nspaces for PADIN team meetings. The costs of these ingredients were expected to be minimal compared \nto the resources we did account for, while tracking down the data to estimate costs for these ingredients \nwould be time consuming. Support personnel indirectly include technical staff (such as the municipal \nsecretary, IT technicians, psychologists, nurses, speech therapists, nutritionists, and pedagogy specialists), \nadministrative personnel (such as those in human resources), and teams dedicated to specific building \nfunctions (such as receptionists, security or doorman, kitchen staff and cleaning staff). While these \npersonnel are required for the work of the entire municipal office to run smoothly, interviews indicated \nthat on average, such staff dedicates up to only two days per year to support the PADIN program. When \nthese two days of costs are distributed across all children in a municipality, the cost per child would be \nnegligible. Likewise, community meetings were meant to be a walkable distance from families\u2019 homes, \nresulting in minimal transportation cost for families. The transportation cost for home visitors to attend \ncommunity meetings is also minimal when distributed across all families served. \nData sources \nTable 2 lists each data source we used to measure program costs at the state, municipality, and \ncommunity levels. In addition to collecting financial records at the state level, a local enumerator traveled \nto each of the 32 municipalities with a structured questionnaire to interview supervisors and other key \npersonnel working on the PADIN program at the municipality level.  During these interviews, we \ncollected information on time-use and salaries of personnel (for example, how much time they spent on \nPADIN versus other social programs), compensation, training, and community meetings.  Supervisors \nfrom 20 municipalities provided itemized expenditure reports on food and supplies.3  \n \n3 Although all municipal expenditure reports cover the categories of office supplies and food, only 11 municipalities \nincluded items related to transportation. Since many reports cannot clarify whether the transportation costs are \nspecific to the PADIN program or apply to the entire secretariat, we excluded these transportation costs from the \nmain analysis. However, we used them to calculate the cost estimates that rely solely on financial records, as shown \nin Figure A6 in Appendix A. \n\n7 \n \nWhen multiple data sources were available for a particular ingredient, we used the source that \nexhibited overall better quality. For example, the numbers of home visitors documented in the interview \ndata from supervisors and the M&E data were consistent for all municipalities except for one, while the \ninformation recorded in the Online Monitoring System substantially and unrealistically diverged from the \nother sources (see Figure A1 in Appendix A). For this ingredient, we adopted the M&E record. Lacking a \nreliable list of all children served from the Online Monitoring System (see Figure A2 in Appendix A), we \nused the number of home visitors, their target caseload (10 families), and the assumption that 95 percent \nof households had only one age-eligible child and 5 percent had two to calculate the total number of \nchildren served. Likewise, when 2018 data on program implementation lacked coverage (for example, for \nneighborhood locations of participating families), we used data from 2019. We preferred actual incurred \nexpenses and disbursements over budgeted costs and verified incurred expenses with the program\u2019s \nfinancial manager.  \nWhen data were missing for an ingredient in a particular municipality, we imputed values either \nusing the average of all municipalities or the most comparable municipality. For example, we substituted \nthe gross salary of the supervisor in one municipality with the gross salary reported by the supervisor in a \nnearby municipality because these two municipalities are similar in size and share a border. Thus, we \nassumed the supervisor positions in the two municipalities would have comparable job responsibilities \nand compensation. Because nearly all municipalities indicated in the survey that they incurred costs for \noffice supplies and food, when 12 municipalities did not provide their monthly expenditure reports, we \nassigned them the average monthly per child costs of office supplies and food calculated for the 20 \nmunicipalities that did provide itemized data.  \nState-level costs. For all state-level costs, we primarily relied on financial records of the PADIN program \nand evenly distributed costs across all children participating in the program in the state. Interviews with \nstate-level program personnel and supervisors were used to address any outliers or discrepancies across \nstate-level records.  \nMunicipal-level personnel. To estimate personnel costs at the municipal level, we relied on the \nsupervisor survey implemented in all 32 sample municipalities. To determine supervision costs for the \nPADIN program, we used the reported percentage of supervisor time dedicated to the program and valued \nit using supervisors\u2019 self-reported gross monthly salary. Four municipalities also reported providing \n\n8 \n \nadditional compensation for home visitors to supplement the monthly payment of BRL 420 (equivalent to \nUSD 115) from the state.4  \nTransportation. Transportation spending as self-reported by the supervisors at the municipalities, \nhowever, is unlikely to accurately reflect the true transportation costs of the program. Interviews with \nsupervisors suggested that in more than half of all municipalities, home visitors arranged their own \ntransportation to the homes of participating families and received no compensation for travel expenses; in \na quarter of municipalities, they arranged their own transportation and received cash compensation.5 Less \nthan 10 percent of supervisors reported that home visitors used municipality-owned vehicles. When \nhousehold neighborhoods are plotted on a map, however, there are municipalities that do not provide \ntravel assistance or compensation even when families are situated well beyond walking distance from the \nmunicipal office. To address this problem, we also estimated transportation costs to provide a more \naccurate account of what resources are needed for implementation, as it may not be realistic in the \nmedium- to long-run to rely on home visitors to pay for work-related travel.  \nTo compensate for limited records related to transportation use by the home visitors, we mapped \nneighborhoods of participating households and used GIS software to estimate the travel time and road \ndistance between these neighborhoods and the municipal office, under the assumptions that the municipal \nadministrative building that hosted the local PADIN office was the starting point for any trip to a \nneighborhood and that a home visitor could visit up to four families within the same neighborhood on a \nsingle trip (see Appendix B for more details). When the distance between the municipal office and the \nneighborhood was less than 2 kilometers, we assumed home visitors could walk and not incur any \ntransportation costs, while we assumed motorbikes could be used for distances between 2 and 10 \nkilometers and shared cars for distances exceeding 10 kilometers. \nTraining. Training costs incurred by the municipalities include compensation for supervisors\u2019 \naccommodation and per diems for home visitors to attend sessions that were organized outside their \nmunicipality.  We relied on the supervisor survey to determine the extent to which supervisors and home \nvisitors were compensated for any costs incurred during training.6 Because training does not fully \ndepreciate each year but personnel do leave the program, we had to make some assumptions to estimate \n \n4  Four municipalities provided additional compensation for home visitors, with this supplement ranging from BRL \n98 (equivalent to USD 27) to BRL 532 (equivalent to USD 146) per month.  \n5 Cash compensation for home visitors\u2019 travel ranged from BRL 23 (equivalent to USD 6) to BRL 317 (equivalent to \nUSD 87) per month.  \n6 Among all 32 municipalities surveyed, 17 reported providing accommodation compensation for supervisors and 6 \nreported offering per diems for home visitors when they traveled to another municipality or city to participate in \ninitial and ongoing training sessions. \n\n9 \n \nannual training costs. Specifically, we spread the costs for supervisors\u2019 initial training over five years and \nthe costs for home visitors over two years. \nFood and supplies. The expenses related to office supplies and food provided for community meetings \nand home visits were estimated based on itemized monthly expenditure reports submitted by 20 \nmunicipalities. We aggregated the costs of items within the office supplies and food categories on a \nmonthly basis and calculated the average across all months with available data.  \nCosts borne by communities. To estimate costs borne by the community, we obtained the frequency of \ncommunity meetings and volunteer involvement for each municipality from the survey and assumed a \nduration of 3 hours for each community meeting based on our communications with the PADIN team. \nWhen a municipality reported volunteer involvement in community meetings in the survey, we used \nguidance from PADIN staff to infer that half of the meetings in that municipality featured one volunteer \nwho dedicated 4 hours to support a single community meeting (organizing the space and preparing and \ndistributing food). We used Brazil\u2019s minimum wage in 2019 as the opportunity cost for volunteers\u2019 time \nspent on community meetings. \nEstimation \nTo make costs comparable across municipalities serving different numbers of families, we \nexpress our cost estimates as monthly unit costs \u2013 specifically, as the cost per child per month. We \nprimarily report the monthly cost per child since home visiting programs do not always operate \nthroughout the entire year, and the duration can vary from one program to another. For state-level \nspending, we evenly distribute costs across all 5,303 children served by the 48 municipalities \nimplementing PADIN in 2018.  When a resource was meant to be used over multiple years, we divided its \ncost by the number of months of potential use to apportion an estimate of monthly cost. We used the 2018 \nofficial exchange rate of 3.65 between Brazilian reals and US dollars to convert the estimated costs in \nBrazilian reals into US dollars.  \nTo arrive at an estimate of total monthly costs per child in a municipality j, we summed the \nmonetized value of all ingredients attributed to a child, regardless whether the ingredients are funded by \nthe state, municipality and community, using equations (1) to (4): \n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\u210e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57= \n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\n10 \u00d7 \u2211\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\n48\n\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57=1\n+ \n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\u210e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\n+\n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\u210e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \n(1) \nwhere \n\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc66 is the total yearly cost borne by the state; \n\n10 \n \n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\u210e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 is the total monthly cost borne by the municipal government in municipality \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57;  \n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5a\u210e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc59 is the total monthly cost borne by the community in municipality \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57; and \n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc50\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 is the number of children served in municipality \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57. \nBecause state-level costs were measured only on an annual basis and the program runs for 10 \nmonths of the year, we divide the total yearly cost borne by the state by 10 months to obtain a monthly \ncost.

Results \nA. Costs of the PADIN program  \n \nUsing equations (1) through (4) and our estimates of their components, we estimate the annual \ncost per child for the PADIN program, with 10 months of implementation, to be BRL 1,597 in 2018, \nequivalent to USD 438. As shown in Table 3, personnel costs account for 64 percent of the total program \ncost. This includes home visitors for implementation (27 percent), state-level personnel for program \ndesign, training organization, supervision, and technical assistance (23 percent) and municipal-level \nsupervision (14 percent). Transportation for home visits and food for training sessions and community \nmeetings each contribute about 10 percent to the total cost, followed by teaching kits, supplies and \ntraining. Cost associated with volunteers\u2019 time is negligible, so we have omitted it from subsequent \nanalyses. Table 4 shows the monthly and annual quantities and prices of the ingredients used at both the \nstate and municipal levels.  \nFigure 1 presents total cost per child per month with a breakdown by funding source \u2013 the state \nand the municipality. State spending amounts to approximately BRL 99 per child per month (equivalent \nto USD 27), with 40 and 36 percent of this, respectively, going towards compensation for home visitors \nand remuneration for the PADIN coordination team at the State Secretariat for Education and the \nRegional Coordination of Education Development (see Figure A3 in Appendix A for a breakdown of \nstate-spending by ingredient). \nOn average, municipalities shouldered 38 percent of the financial cost required to sustain the \ndaily operations of the PADIN program, which is equivalent to an average of BRL 60 per child per \nmonth.8 This proportion ranges from 22 percent to 52 percent (See Figure A4 in Appendix A) or from \nBRL 28 to BRL 108. We found no significant correlation between municipal spending and the \nmunicipality\u2019s GDP per capita, suggesting that wealthier municipalities do not necessarily spend more \n(see Figure A5 in Appendix A). Without additional information (namely, data on the variation in program \neffectiveness or children\u2019s developmental deficits across municipalities), it is not possible to determine \nwhether the variation in municipal spending reflects differences in effort, efficiency, needs, or \nuncommitted budget. No matter the cause - despite the standardization of the provision of home visitors, \n \n8 Financial costs do not include community contributions. The calculation of the average municipal cost across all \nmunicipalities accounts for variations in the number of families and children served by each municipality. As a \nresult, this number represents a weighted average of cost per child per month across all 32 municipalities, with the \nweights proportional to the number of children served in each respective municipality. \n\n13 \n \nstate support, training, and teaching kits - families and children across various municipalities experience \nvery different levels of resource intensity in the PADIN program.  \nThe breakdown of costs by funding source for each program ingredient (Figure 2) also \ndemonstrates that the municipality is responsible for key elements of the program, as they are the sole or \nprimary funder for supervision and transportation. This breakdown also makes evident that the combined \ncost associated with supervision and the involvement of state personnel in the program exceeds spending \non frontline personnel like the home visitors.  \nTo investigate the proximate causes underlying the differences in program cost across \nmunicipalities, we examine variation across municipalities for each ingredient separately. Figure 3 \npresents a \u201cheat map\u201d for the major ingredients of the PADIN program, restricted solely to municipal \nexpenditure. Darker colors represent greater cost. The more color variation within an ingredient, the more \nvariation in cost there is across municipalities. Supervision and transportation appear to drive much of the \ncost of the program that is borne by municipalities, which is consistent with the program\u2019s reliance on \nmunicipalities for these activities.  \nThe data also suggest that some part of the variation in cost across municipalities stems from \nvariation in implementation. First, in Figure 3, we see that the per-child costs of supervision and \ntransportation vary considerably across municipalities. Second, when we break down the variation in \nsupervision costs into two components \u2013 the amount of time that supervisors spend on the program and \nthe gross salary that municipalities provide supervisors over and above the fixed transfer from the state \u2013 \nwe find a sizable range across municipalities for both components (Figure 4).  \nAccording to the design of PADIN, supervisors are responsible for supervising program activities \nin their assigned municipalities. They hold weekly meetings with home visitors, prepare monthly and \nannual monitoring reports, and coordinate with other departments and partner institutions serving the \nsame population. Beyond these duties, some supervisors also take on roles outside the PADIN program \nand can serve as a principal or teacher in a school or as literacy coordinator.  \nFigure 4 plots the percentage of time supervisors devote to the PADIN program against their \ngross monthly salary. While there is a cluster of municipalities in which supervisors devote all their time \nto the PADIN program, the data reveal a sizable range, from 25 percent of a supervisor\u2019s working hours \nto 100 percent.9 There is also a large range in the gross salaries that supervisors received outside the \nPADIN scholarship \u2013 from BRL 700 (equivalent to USD 192) to BRL 4,575 (equivalent to USD 1,253) \n \n9 There is also a cluster of reported level of effort at 50 percent.  \n\n14 \n \nper month, as self-reported by supervisors \u2013 even though supervisors have similar qualifications across \nmunicipalities.  \nOther data collected to cost the program indicate variation in implementation across \nmunicipalities. For example, the design of the PADIN program calls for home visitors to visit each family \ntwice a month. In practice, 27 municipalities adhered to this frequency, while 5 municipalities reported \nweekly visits, making the average family 2.3 visits per month with each visit lasting 63 minutes. The \nfrequency of community meetings also varied: while three municipalities only organized community \nmeetings once every six months or bi-monthly, twelve municipalities managed to hold community \nmeetings twice per month, or even four times per month. Fifteen municipalities offered community \nmeetings once per month following the program design, while two municipalities did not have a clear \nstandard but had approximately 10 meetings in the previous year.  \nB. Data quality \nFor a few program ingredients, we had multiple sources of data. For example, we asked \nsupervisors to report on compensation for the travel required for home visitors to implement the program. \nWe also plotted the neighborhoods of participating families and municipal offices on a map and used fuel \ncosts, amortized vehicle costs, travel distances, and commute times (See Appendix B) to estimate the \ncosts associated with visiting households, assuming that home visitors would visit up to four households \nin a neighborhood on the same workday.  \nFigure 5 demonstrates the importance of interrogating program reported costs with other sources \nof data. For almost all municipalities, there is a discrepancy between transportation costs estimated from \nthe supervisor survey and transportation costs measured using GIS data and the prices of fuel and \nvehicles. In all but four municipalities, the self-reported costs are far below the costs estimated using the \ningredients method to break costs into their constituent quantities (distance and travel times) and prices. \nThe average discrepancy is BRL 14 (equivalent to USD 4) per child per month and ranges from BRL 0.13 \nto BRL 42 (equivalent to USD 12). Thus, relying solely on self-reported data from program personnel \nwould lead to underestimates of the transportation costs associated with the program. These discrepancies \nalso provide a measure of the extent to which home visitors themselves incur costs stemming from \nprogram implementation.  \nSimilarly, other data required to estimate costs, such as the number of home visitors and children \nserved in each municipality, were collected from three different sources (supervisor survey, M&E reports \nof the program, and the Online Monitoring System).  Figures A1 and A2 in Appendix A present \ndiscrepancies among the data sources and suggest that records from the Online Monitoring System do not \n\n15 \n \naccurately reflect program implementation. Because these records tend to inflate the number of home \nvisitors per municipality and undercount the number of children served, relying on these records for this \nbasic information could lead to substantial overestimates of the cost of the PADIN program.  \nOur analysis also underscores the importance of using an ingredient-based method to accurately \ncapture the actual utilization of resources. If we rely on the financial records collected from both state and \nmunicipal governments, the cost per child per month would be BRL 203 (equivalent to USD 56) (see \nFigure A6 in Appendix A). This is 27% higher than our estimate, which was derived from the ingredients-\nbased method and multiple rounds of data validation. At the state level, the costs of scholarships for \nsupervisors and home visitors were lower in financial records than our estimates, whereas the costs for \nteaching kits were higher. These two discrepancies nearly balance each other out. At the municipal level, \nadditional compensation for supervisors and home visitors was not recorded. The transportation cost \nestimated from the municipal itemized expenditure reports is almost five times our estimated \ntransportation cost. This discrepancy arises because many municipalities included the expenses for \nvehicle rental, maintenance, and fuel for the entire secretariat, rather than solely for the implementation of \nthe PADIN program. \nV. Conclusions \nThis study assembled data from surveys, administrative and financial records, and spatial data to \nestimate costs for the PADIN home visiting program, a state-led initiative in Cear\u00e1, Brazil. Findings \nsuggest total annual costs of BRL 1,597 in 2018 or USD 438 per child for 10 months of implementation. \nAfter adjusting for the length of the intervention, our estimate of cost per child per month (USD 44) is \nsimilar in magnitude to costs calculated for home visiting programs that provide weekly home visits for \napproximately 10 months or above, such as China REACH (USD 47), Reach Up and Learn in Colombia \n(USD 48), Reach Up and Learn in India (USD 12), Reach Up and Learn in Jamaica (USD 66), Cuna Mas \nin Peru (USD 27), and Reach Up in the Rep\u00fablica Bolivariana de Venezuela (USD 37) (see Appendix C). \nThe top three cost components of PADIN include compensation for the home visitors (27 percent of total \ncosts), compensation for state-level personnel (23 percent), and compensation for supervision (14 \npercent). \nA breakdown of costs by funding source suggests that although PADIN is a state-level program, \nmunicipalities bear a non-trivial proportion of the costs of implementation - an average of 38 percent of \ntotal costs. The assembled cost data also suggest substantial variation both in per-child spending across \nmunicipalities and in program implementation with the highest cost municipality spending three times \nmore than the amount per child spent by the lowest cost municipality. Thus, though the state equalizes \n\n16 \n \nper-capita spending on frontline workers by paying the salaries of the home visitors and provides \nsignificant technical assistance, municipalities choose to augment or not augment this funding and thus \nspend very different amounts per child.  \nSimilarly, the analysis revealed that home visitors themselves had to bear the transportation costs \nassociated with the program in half of all municipalities. Because transportation is an essential element of \nprogram implementation, this financing arrangement may limit the pool of home visitors that can be \nrecruited and may threaten program sustainability.  \nThis costing exercise also revealed the limitations of relying on a single data source to cost \nprogram elements and the importance of using the ingredients method to break costs into their constituent \nprices and quantities. Some administrative records (data from the Online Monitoring System, for \nexample) did not consistently report basic program elements such as the number of home visitors \nassigned to a municipality or the number of children served. Similarly, transportation costs reported by \nsupervisors in a survey and documented in expenditure reports diverged substantially from costs \nestimated using travel distances and prices associated with fuel and vehicles. Thus, lessons for future \ncosting exercises would be to use the ingredients-based method (or activity-based costing) and rely on \nmultiple sources of data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n17 \n \nBibliography \nAlmond, D., and J.

State costs of the PADIN program, by ingredient (percentage of total state costs) \n \nNotes. Costs borne by the state were estimated based on the PADIN financial spreadsheets provided by the PADIN \nteam in SEDUC, as well as through email exchanges with them. The state personnel cost covers the salaries and \nbonuses of 24 professionals who are responsible for recruiting and training supervisors and home visitors, \ndeveloping content, coordinating, and organizing training sessions.  \n \n \n \n\n31 \n \nFigure A4. Cost per child per month borne by funding source (percentage of total program costs) \n \nNotes. The calculation of the cost distribution by funding source used administrative data, survey data, GIS data, and \ninterviews. The municipalities have been anonymized and labelled with a random number between 1 and 32 to \nprotect the identity of survey respondents. The calculation of the average municipal cost across all municipalities \n(percentage of total costs depicted by the dashed vertical line) accounts for variation in the number of families and \nchildren served by each municipality. Thus, the average proportion of municipal costs presented as \u201cAll\u201d represents \na weighted average across all 32 municipalities, with the weights proportional to the number of children served in \neach municipality. \n \n \n\n32 \n \nFigure A5. Correlation between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita and cost per child per month \nborne by the municipality \n \nNotes. Cost per child per month borne by the municipality was estimated using administrative data, survey data, GIS \ndata, and interviews.

Deviation in the estimated cost per child per month (in BRL) from financial records compared \nto our estimate using the ingredients-based method \n \nNotes. The cost per child per month estimated using the ingredients method used administrative data, survey data, \nGIS data, and interviews.

Transportation costs \nTo estimate the transportation costs associated with home visits, we gathered data on the number \nof households served in each neighborhood, placed neighborhoods on a geo-coded map of Brazil, and \nused Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to simulate household locations within \nneighborhoods and estimate travel distance and travel time from these households to the corresponding \nmunicipal administrative office, the local headquarters of the PADIN program.  \nMapping households and municipal offices \nWe geocoded the neighborhoods of families participating in the program (as destinations) and the \nmunicipality's administrative buildings (as origins). Administrative buildings for all 32 municipalities \nwere successfully located using the Google Maps API. Out of the 821 neighborhoods listed in PADIN \nrecords, 757 were located within the correct municipality using three geocoding services: Open Street \nMap, Pelias, and Google Maps. We omitted from the analysis 64 neighborhood locations recorded for \nparticipating families, as these locations could not be located using any of these three services.  \nBecause the exact locations of the households could not be shared with us for data privacy \nreasons, we used their neighborhood locations to impute their distance and travel time from the municipal \noffice. To do this, we matched the destination neighborhoods to census tracts provided by the Brazilian \ngovernment and randomly sampled potential locations corresponding to the number of visited households \nwithin a given neighborhood, using a built-up dataset from the Facebook High Resolution Settlement \nLayer. With those randomly sampled locations, we created a map of \u201csimulated\u201d household locations.  \nEstimating travel distances and times \nLeveraging Mapbox Directions API, we estimated travel distance and travel time between each \nsimulated household location and the administrative building of the municipality. Distances under 2 \nkilometers were designated for walking. For distances between 2 and 10 kilometers, we assumed home \n\n35 \n \nvisitors would travel by motorbike.11 Beyond 10 kilometers, we assumed home visitors would employ \nshared cars for their commutes. To the extent that travel would not be optimally coordinated across \nlocations and home visitors in practice, our estimates of transportation cost are conservative.  \nProjecting a transportation profile for each municipality  \nBecause we lacked precise locations of households within neighborhoods, we used the simulated \ndataset of travel distances and travel times for each home visitor, neighborhood, and municipality to \ncreate transportation profiles for each municipality. This profile indicates the number of households \nassigned to each transportation mode, along with their average travel distance and travel time. \nSpecifically, using the simulated dataset, we calculated the percentage of households in each municipality \nthat could be reached via walking, motorcycling, or car sharing, and further computed the average travel \ndistance and travel time for each transportation mode. These percentages were then multiplied by the total \nnumber of households actually served in each municipality, resulting in the number of households \nallocated to each transportation mode (See equation B.1).12  \n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58= \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\u00d7\n\u2211\n\u2211\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\n\u0de3\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51=1\n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49\n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63=1\n\u2211\n\u2211\n\u2211\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\n\u0de3\n\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51=1\n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49\n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63=1\n3\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58=1\n \n \n(B.1) \nwhere  \n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 is the number of households reached by transportation mode \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 in municipality \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57;  \n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 is the number of households served in municipality \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57; \n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\n\u0de3 is the number of households in neighborhood \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 of municipality \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 visited by home visitor \n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63 using transportation mode \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58, as estimated from the simulated household location data; and \n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc49 and \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37 are the upper bounds of the sequences of home visitors and neighborhoods respectively.  \nEstimating the average number of households visited per trip \n \n11 The version of Mapbox Directions API we used did not support estimating travel time and travel distance for \nmotorbike transportation. To address this, we specified the \u201cdriving-traffic\u201d mode within Mapbox Directions API \n(that is, driving with consideration for traffic conditions) for households located beyond the 2-kilometer walking \nradius. Because road usage and traffic conditions for both motorbikes and cars should be similar, this strategy should \nprovide a reasonable estimate for motorbike journeys. \n12 The simulated household locations accounted for 84 percent of total households served across all 32 \nmunicipalities. In one municipality, neighborhood information was available for only 3 out of the 80 households \nserved. Similarly, in another municipality, the simulated dataset covered only 21 percent of program households. \nConsequently, the transportation cost estimates for these municipalities might be less accurate compared to those \nmunicipalities that provided more comprehensive data. \n\n36 \n \nTo account for the potential for home visitors to cluster home visits within the same \nneighborhood, we used the duration of home visits reported by the supervisors (on average 63 minutes per \nvisit) to set the maximum number of households a home visitor could visit during a typical trip to a \nneighborhood given that all households may not be available to meet on the same day. We set this number \nat 4 visits per day. Using the simulated dataset, for each neighborhood and each transportation mode, we \ncomputed the number of trips necessary for the home visitor to commute to the neighborhood to complete \none cycle of home visits (See equation B.2). We rounded the division up to be conservative.  \n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\n\u0de3\n= \u125c\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\n\u0de3\n4\n\u125d \n \n(B.2) \n \nwhere \n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51\n\u0de3  is the number of trips required by home visitor \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc63 to complete one cycle of family visits in \nneighborhood \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc51 of municipality \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 using transportation mode \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58, as estimated from the simulated \nhousehold location data. \nWe aggregated the number of households and trips for each home visitor across all \nneighborhoods that they serve during one cycle of home visits.

Regarding fuel cost, we converted the total travel distance into \nliters of gasoline required, using the fuel economy figures for cars and motorbikes in Brazil.

Subsequently, we multiplied the \nliters of gasoline by the price of fuel, BRL 4.5 per liter in 201916, to calculate the overall fuel costs for \nboth cars and motorbikes (see Equation B.9). The fuel cost estimation for cars might be slightly \nconservative, as we assumed that two home visitors would share a car for a trip but we did not halve the \nfuel cost, allowing for coverage of the commute between the neighborhoods served by these two home \nvisitors in some capacity. \n\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57\n\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39= \u0dcd\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n100\n\u00d7 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\u00d7 \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc39\ud835\udc39\n3\n\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58=2\n \n(B.9) \nwhere \n \n14 This is the fuel economy of light-duty vehicles in Brazil for 2019, published by International Energy Agency as \npart of Global Fuel Economy Initiative 2021. \n15 The fuel economy of motorbikes was extracted from a study conducted in Curitiba, State of Paran\u00e1, Brazil.

Our assumption was that a single \nmotorbike can be used for up to 15 days in a month, allowing for some flexibility to coordinate schedules. \nAs a result, the number of motorbikes required by a municipality would be calculated by dividing the day \ncount by the maximum days a motorbike can be used (i.e., 15 days), rounded up to the nearest whole \nnumber (see Equation B.11).  \n\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57= \u1252\n\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58\n15\n\u1253           (\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc58 = 2) \n(B.11) \nwhere \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57 is the number of motorbikes needed in municipality \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc57.  \nThe initial purchase cost of a commonly used, light motorbike in Brazil, such as a 125 c.c.

One difference is that the cumulative car usage day count, as calculated \nfor motorbikes, was halved to reflect the assumption that two home visitors would share a car during a \ntrip. The second difference is that the market price of a commonly used, compact sedan in Brazil, such as \nthe Volkswagen Gol, totaled BRL 36,373 in 201919.

To ensure comparability, we made the following \nadjustments to the reported cost estimates: \n\u2022 \nWhen costs were reported on a per-targeted-child basis, we used the program's participation rate \nto convert these figures to a cost per participating child.  \n\u2022 \nReported annual costs per child were converted to monthly costs by dividing the annual amount \nby 12. \n\u2022 \nThe total cost estimates for the entire intervention were divided by the intervention's duration (in \nmonths) to determine the monthly cost per child. \n\u2022 \nUnless otherwise specified, we assumed costs were reported in USD in the first year of \nimplementation. We then used the Consumer Price Index to adjust these costs to 2018 USD \nvalues. \nStudies were considered to have used the ingredient-based method if they: i) specified it in the \nmethods section, or ii) disaggregated the ingredients and reported the quantities. If it was obvious that the \ncost data were only extracted from financial records, we considered that the ingredient-based method was \nnot used for the cost analysis. \nThere are several caveats to consider before using the table to compare programs.  \n\u2022 \nVisit frequency: PADIN was designed to offer biweekly home visits. In contrast, other programs \neither had weekly or monthly home visits. The cost per child per month for home visiting \nprograms is not strictly proportional to the frequency of visits. This is because certain one-time \nsetup costs, like personnel time for content development, training, and supervision, are incurred \nupfront regardless of visit frequency. \n\u2022 \nValidity: The comprehensiveness and rigor of the cost analyses across programs vary \nsignificantly. Some studies utilized the \u201cingredients method\u201d, while others solely relied on \nprogram budgets. \nCombined intervention costs: The reported costs for some interventions, such as \u201cReach-Up and Learn\u201d \nin Colombia, \u201cReach Up\u201d in Venezuela, and the \u201cNiger Safety Nets Project\u201d, represent a combined sum \nfor home visits and other supplementary interventions. Based on the information provided in the studies, \nwe could not isolate the cost of the home visits alone. \nStudies reviewed: \nAraujo, M. C., M. Dormal, S. Grantham-McGregor, F. Lazarte, M.

(2003; henceforward ELL) have popularized the estimation of poverty and inequal-\nity at the small area level, also referred to as \u201cpoverty mapping\u201d.1 Poverty here measures the\nshare of individuals whose income or consumption falls below a given poverty line. Collecting\nhousehold income and consumption data is expensive. This is particularly true for developing\ncountries where much of the income does not come from wage employment.\nConsequently,\nincome and consumption data is typically only available in the form of household income and\nconsumption expenditure surveys. The sample size of these surveys is sufficient for the estima-\ntion of national and possibly sub-regional welfare, but too small to estimate welfare at the level\nof small areas. Small areas here refer to administrative areas that are below the province level,\nthink of district or possibly even the municipality level.\nEstimating poverty at the small area level is made possible by combining household survey\ndata with unit record population census data.2\nThe census has data on variables such as\ndemographics, education, employment and housing, which serve as predictors of household\nincome, but not the household income variable itself. Crucially, data on these predictors are\nalso collected by the income survey. The income survey is used to train a household income\nmodel that is then used to predict income for every household in the population census. These\npredicted incomes can subsequently be aggregated to obtain estimates of poverty at the small\narea level.\nThis approach has been applied to obtain maps of poverty in over 60 countries\nworldwide. For reviews of the literature on small area estimation, see e.g., Haslett (2013, 2016),\nRao and Molina (2015), Tzavidis et al. (2018), Das and Haslett (2019), and Corral et al. (2020).\nTo accommodate spatial correlation in errors, a nested error structure is assumed where\nthe total error is the sum of a household-specific error and a location error. The location error\nis typically modeled at the small area level. The total error observed for sampled households\nclearly carries information about the area random effect. Empirical Bayes (EB) estimation, also\nknown as Empirical Best estimation, exploits this for the purpose of prediction, i.e. it uses the\nresiduals observed in the survey to predict the location effects for sampled small areas, which\nin turn are used to predict local poverty rates.\nWorking out the conditional distribution for the location error (conditional on observed\nresiduals) requires making distributional assumptions. It is standard in the literature on EB\n1First attempts to estimate poverty at the small area level using aggregate data, dates back to the seminal\nwork by Fay and Herriott (1979).\n2Population censuses provide complete coverage of a country and collects household and individual attributes\nthat tend to be highly predictive of household welfare, think of household composition, education, employment,\nand dwelling characteristics, making it the ideal source of data for poverty mapping.\nAn alternative source\nof data that similarly provides complete coverage of the country is remote-sensing data, think of night-time-\nlights, population density, land type and use, greenness, and local climate and pollution variables. The unit of\nobservation at which these data can be connected to the household survey in this case would be the village level\nrather than the household level. For studies that have explored the use of remote-sensing data to obtain small\narea estimates of poverty, see e.g., Burke et al. (2021), Chi et al. (2022), Engstrom et al. (2022), Jean et al.\n(2016), Merfeld and Newhouse (2023), Newhouse et al. (2022), Newhouse (2023), Pokhriyal and Jacques (2017),\nVan der Weide et al. (2024), and the references therein. Studies vary in the resolution of imagery used, with\nhigher resolution images allowing for a richer set of predictors that can be extracted from them (see e.g. Marx\net al., 2019).\n2\n\nestimation to assume normally distributed errors, in which case the conditional distributions\nare also normal (see Molina and Rao, 2010).\nAssuming normality is however not without\ncost. Since poverty and inequality are non-linear functions of household consumption (and by\nextension non-linear functions of the errors), misspecification in the error distributions may\nintroduce an error in the small area estimates of poverty.\nELL makes minimal assumptions about the errors, motivated by their empirical application\nwhere the errors did not conform to a normal distribution. Unfortunately, the non-parametric\nestimator for the distribution functions adopted by ELL does not lend itself for Empirical Bayes\n(EB) estimation. Molina and Rao (2010; henceforward MR) instead prioritizes EB estimation\nunder the assumption of normally distributed errors. Where ELL accept a loss in precision\nby not implementing EB estimation, MR accept a loss in precision that might stem from a\nmisspecification of the error distribution functions. Throughout the paper, higher precision will\nrefer to lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).\nThe approach put forward in this paper accommodates both EB estimation and non-\nnormally distributed errors.\nWe achieve this by fitting finite normal mixtures (NM) to the\nerror distribution functions. Normal mixtures are extremely flexible; they are able to fit any\nwell-behaved distribution function, and are ideally suited for accommodating EB estimation.\nWith respect to the household idiosyncratic error term, we follow ELL by drawing from the\nempirical realizations of the idiosyncratic errors (with replacement).3 To verify what deviations\nfrom normality (or degrees of non-normality) are empirically relevant, we estimate the respec-\ntive error distributions using data from 142 household surveys across 16 countries from different\nregions and different income groups.\nOur findings are the following. An inspection of the estimated area- and idiosyncratic error\ndistributions across the 142 household surveys reveals significant deviations from normality,\nespecially for the household idiosyncratic component. Household errors have skewness ranging\nfrom -1.5 to 1.5 and kurtosis from 4 to 10 (the skewness of area errors ranges between -1\nand 1, and kurtosis from 2 to 8, disregarding outliers).\nWhen the area error is small (2.5\npercent of total error or less), the benefit of accounting for non-normality is seen to outweigh\nthe loss stemming from foregoing Empirical Best prediction. As soon as the share of area error\napproaches 5 percent or higher, EB prediction dominates non-EB prediction across practically all\nempirically observed error distributions. Non-normal-EB prediction performs best in all cases.\nThe improvement in performance relative to normal-EB is however comparatively marginal at\nhigher levels of the location effect. Similarly, the improvement is marginal when compared to\nELL at near-zero levels of the location effect. While the gains may range between marginal\n(near-zero reduction in RMSE) and meaningful (up to a 15-25 percent reduction in RMSE),\nthey are always positive. Given that non-normal-EB prediction is easy to implement, there is\nno downside to using it.\nHighly disaggregated estimates of poverty and inequality have inspired a range of applica-\n3Another way of relaxing the normality assumption is explored in Bikauskaite et al. (2020), where a mixture\nis applied to the full nested error model, rather than fitting flexible mixture distributions to the respective error\ndistributions separately.\n3\n\ntions. A natural use of poverty maps is for the targeting of social assistance programs, see\ne.g., Banerjee et al. (2025) and Smythe and Blumenstock (2022). Elbers et al. (2007) show\nin empirical applications to Madagascar, Cambodia, and Ecuador, that reductions in poverty\nachieved with uniform transfers can be realized with less than half the budget if the transfers\ncould be targeted on the basis of district or municipality level estimates of poverty. Small area\nestimates are also increasingly used as regressors in empirical analysis, see e.g. Araujo et al.\n(2008), Baird et al. (2013), Bazzi (2017), Crost et al. (2014), Demombynes and Ozler (2005),\nElbers et al. (2005), Maloney and Caicedo (2015), and Mendez and Van Patten (2022).4 To\nhighlight some examples, Araujo et al. (2008), using data from Ecuador, find that villages with\nhigher levels of inequality are less likely to invest in public goods that would benefit the poor\n(which they attribute to elite capture). Demombynes and Ozler (2005) find that inequality at\nthe small area level has a positive relationship with local crime rates in an empirical application\nto South Africa. Finally, the multiple imputation methods underpinning small area estimation\nare also finding applications in the monitoring of poverty over time at a more aggregate level in\ncontexts where household consumption surveys have been discontinued or interrupted, prompt-\ning researchers to impute household consumption data into alternative surveys, see e.g., Tarozzi\n(2007) and Sinha Roy and Van der Weide (2025).\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The problem statement is formulated\nin Section 2. In Section 3 we briefly summarize the two competing approach adopted in the\nexisting literature: Non-normal-Non-EB and Normal-EB. The newly proposed approach, Non-\nnormal-EB, is presented in Section 4. Sections 5 presents a simulation study based on empirical\ndata from 142 household surveys across 16 countries, respectively. Finally, Section 6 concludes.\n2\nProblem statement: Small area estimation of welfare\nLet yah measure log per capita income (or expenditure) for household h residing in area a, and\nlet sah denote the number of household members for that same household.5 Suppose that at\nthe household level the data generating process (DGP) satisfies:\nyah = xT\nah\u03b2 + ua + \u03b5ah,\n(1)\nwhere xah is a vector with independent variables, and where ua and \u03b5ah are zero expectation\nerror terms that are independent of each other.6 The subscripts indicate target area (or domain)\n4Data combination models can also be applied beyond small area estimation applications, see e.g., Graham\net al. (2016).\n5Ideally the household income or consumption expenditure data is adjusted for spatial and temporal price\ndifferences, i.e., is measured in real terms. As this is not the focus of this study, we will be abstracting away from\nthat, but refer the interested reader to e.g., e.g. Gibson et al. (2017) and van Veelen and van der Weide (2008).\n6The assumed nested error structure is a common and practical way of accounting for spatial correlation\nbetween errors. The nested error structure could be extended to a two-fold nested error model, see e.g., Marhuenda\net al. (2017). Alternatively one could assume a spatial auto-correlation structure, see e.g., Bell and Bockstael\n(2000), Pratesi and Salvati (2008), and Kelejian and Prucha (2010). In that case, the correlation between errors\ncould be modeled as a smooth decaying function of distance rather than the step function implied by the nested\nerror structure. The regressors included in xah typically includes interactions and transformations of selected\n4\n\na and household h.7 Let us assume that errors are homoskedastic, so that for each household h\nand area a we have: var[yah|xah] = \u03c32\nu+\u03c32\n\u03b5. Throughout the paper it is assumed that consistent\nestimators for the variance parameters are available, which we shall denote by \u02c6\u03c32\nu and \u02c6\u03c32\n\u03b5.8 We\nwill not make any assumptions about the shape of the error distributions at this point.\nLet A be the total number of areas covered by the income survey and let na be the number\nof households that have been sampled in area a, so that n = PA\na=1 na equals the total sample\nsize of the survey. We shall denote the total household error by: eah = yah \u2212xT\nah\u03b2, and its area\na average by \u00afea = \u00afya \u2212\u00afxT\na \u03b2 where \u00afea = P\nh eah/na.\nWe will also use the notation ea = (ea,1, . . . , ea,na) which is a vector of length na that\ncontains the residuals for all households from area a. With a slight abuse of terminology we\nwill at times refer to the errors eah and \u00afea as data (as if we know the parameter vector \u03b2). Let\ny(a) and e(a) denote vectors of length Na with elements yah and eah for all households from the\npopulation. Similarly, x(a) will denote a matrix with rows given by xT\nah for all Na households.\nya, ea and xa will denote the survey sample analogues. Finally, let the probability distribution\nfunctions (probability density functions) for ua and \u03b5ah be denoted by Fu (p(u)) and G\u03b5 (p(\u03b5)).\nThe objective is to estimate:\nE[W(y(a))|x(a), ya]\n=\nZ\nW(x(a)\u03b2 + e)p(e|ea)de\n(2)\n\u2243\nZ Z\nW(x(a)\u03b2 + u + \u03b5)p(\u03b5)p(u|ea)d\u03b5du,\n(3)\nwhere p(u|ea) is the conditional probability density function for the location area error u (con-\nditional on observed residuals) and where the welfare function W will generally be non-linear.\nPopular choices of W are the share of individuals whose income falls below a pre-specified\npoverty line (also known as the head-count poverty rate) and the Gini index of income in-\nequality. Head-count poverty is a special case of the Foster\u2013Greer\u2013Thorbecke family of poverty\nindices, see Foster et al. (1984).\nIn effect EB estimates are obtained by integrating out area errors ua using probability density\np(ua|ea), i.e. the probability density of ua conditional on ea observed from the survey. Non-EB\nestimates are obtained by using the unconditional density p(ua). The challenge is to work out\np(ua|ea) along with the marginals p(ua) and p(\u03b5ah) without imposing restrictions about their\nform so that the resulting conditional density p(ua|ea) can also take on any form. Currently, the\ncovariates to account for area heterogeneities (see Tarozzi and Deaton, 2009; Tarozzi, 2011). See also Das and\nChambers (2017) and Lahiri and Salvati (2023).\nModel selection methods such as Lasso as well as machine\nlearning methods are also increasingly used to identify the relevant model variables (including interactions and\ntransformations). See e.g., Corral et al. (2024) and the references therein for an overview on the use of machine\nlearning in this context.\n7These areas may refer to geographic areas such as districts or municipalities, but also to non-geographic\ndomains such as ethnic groups or age groups, say.\n8A commonly used estimator for the variance parameters from a nested error model is Henderson\u2019s method III\nestimator (see Henderson, 1953; and Searle et al., 1992), which may be viewed as a method of moments estimator\nwhich does not require any assumptions about the shape of the error distributions. Alternative estimators are\nrestricted maximum likelihood, minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation (MINQUE; see e.g. Westfall, 1987;\nSearle et al., 1992), and so-called spectral decomposition estimation (see e.g. Wang and Yin, 2002; and Wu et\nal., 2009).\n5\n\nliterature on EB estimation avoids this challenge by assuming normally distributed marginals,\nin which case the conditional distribution will be normal too. Estimation of \u03b2 is obviously of\nprimary importance when estimating E[W], but in this paper we will concentrate on the error\ndistributions and assume that \u03b2 is known. Even if \u03b2 is estimated perfectly, getting the error\ndistribution wrong still has the potential to introduce a bias.\nFor non-linear W, the expected value E[W] will be a function of the higher moments of\nthe distributions of both u and \u03b5. Getting these moments wrong (i.e., getting the distribu-\ntions wrong) is one source of bias. Errors in the conditional density p(u|ea), stemming from\nmisspecification of the error distributions, is another source of bias. The latter bias persists\neven for linear W. Recently, Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh (2009) and McCulloch and Neuhaus\n(2011) have explored the magnitude of the bias that is introduced by getting the first moment\nof p(u|ea) wrong and found it to be modest in the case of linear W. Accordingly, our proposed\nestimator is anticipated to provide more value added in the case of nonlinear W.\nStandard errors can be obtained by means of simulation which is ideally suited for estimating\nquantities that are non-linear functions of the random variables at hand, as is the case with\nmeasures of poverty and inequality. Let R denote the number of simulations. The estimator\nthen takes the form:\n\u02c6\u00b5 = 1\nR\nR\nX\nr=1\nW\n\u0010\n\u02dcy(r)\n(a), s(a)\n\u0011\n,\n(4)\nwhere \u02dcy(r)\n(a) denotes the r-th simulated (or predicted) income vector with elements \u02dcy(r)\nah = xT\nah \u02dc\u03b2(r)+\n\u02dcu(r)\na +\u02dc\u03b5(r)\nah . With each simulation, both the model parameters \u02dc\u03b2(r) and the errors \u02dcu(r)\na\nand \u02dc\u03b5(r)\nah are\ndrawn from their estimated distributions.9 In the end this gives R simulated poverty rates. The\npoint estimates and their corresponding standard errors are obtained by computing respectively\nthe average and the standard deviation over these simulated values.\n3\nTwo alternative approaches\nIn this section we will briefly discuss the two most-commonly adopted approaches to date: (1)\nEmpirical Best (EB) prediction advocated by Molina and Rao (2010; MR) which assumes that\nerrors are normally distributed, and (2) the approach put forward by Elbers et al. (2003; ELL)\nthat allows for non-normally distributed errors, but does not adopt EB prediction. Moving\nforward, we will also refer to these approaches as non-normal-non-EB and normal-EB, respec-\ntively.\n9Our preferred method is to draw \u02dc\u03b2(r) by re-estimating the model parameters using the r-th bootstrap version\nof the survey sample. Alternatively, \u02dc\u03b2(r) may be drawn from its estimated asymptotic distribution. The difference\nbetween these two alternatives is expected to be modest, unless the survey sample is particularly small so that\nfinite sample effects may play a role.\n6\n\n3.1\nELL: Non-normal-non-EB estimation\nELL makes minimal assumptions about the errors ua and \u03b5ah. They proceed by first obtaining\nestimates of the area errors ua and \u03b5ah, which then allows them to sample from the empirical\nerrors \u02c6ua and \u02c6\u03b5ah. ua is estimated as the simple area average of the total residuals (appropriately\nre-scaled so that the sample variance of \u02c6ua equals the estimate of \u03c32\nu that corrects for the\ncontribution of the area average of \u03b5ah). The estimate for \u03b5ah is obtained by subtracting \u02c6ua\nfrom the total residual (re-scaled so that its sample variance matches \u03c32\n\u03b5).10 Note that \u02c6ua equals\nthe sum of ua and \u00af\u03b5a. The latter term will typically be small in magnitude. It is assumed that\nits effect on the estimator for the distribution of ua will be negligible.\nThe advantage of this approach is that it does not restrict the shape of the error distribu-\ntions. A shortcoming is that it does not take full advantage of all the available data, i.e., it\ndoes not lend itself for Empirical Bayes (EB) estimation. Specifically, it does not offer a means\nof evaluating the conditional distribution of ua (conditional on the mean residual for observed\nfor area a in the event area a is included in the survey sample), i.e., p(u|ea). Working out the\nconditional distribution is not a trivial exercise without making further distributional assump-\ntions. Consequently ELL decided to forego EB estimation altogether. In doing so, they have\naccepted a certain loss in efficiency by not fully utilizing all available information.\n3.2\nNormal-EB estimation\nMR put forward an approach that prioritizes EB estimation. The residuals ea (for area a covered\nby the survey) clearly carry information about the area random effect ua. In the extreme where\nna tends to infinity \u00afea will perfectly reveal ua. They closely follow ELL with the notable differ-\nence that the area errors are drawn from the conditional distribution (for areas covered by the\nsurvey sample) under the assumption that the errors are normally distributed. As we have seen,\nunder this assumption the conditional distribution of \u02dcua is normal too and its parameter can be\neasily determined.11 Where ELL accept a loss in precision by not implementing EB estimation,\nMolina and Rao (2010) accept a loss in precision that might stem from a misspecification of the\nerror distribution functions.\nELL was motivated by estimating poverty and inequality in developing countries where\nthe share of small areas (or domains) that are covered by the income surveys typically ranges\nbetween of 5 to 25 percent of all domains in the population. In this case the benefits of EB\nestimation may be more modest. However, in more developed countries, or countries where\ntravel costs that are incurred when covering all small areas are manageable, income surveys\noften cover a much larger number of the domains. In fact, there are numerous examples where\nsurveys cover the majority (up to 100 percent) of domains in the country. In those instances,\nthere may be clear benefits to adopting EB estimation.\n10Note that ELL allows for heteroskedasticity, so that \u03c32\n\u03b5 can be household-specific.\n11This is arguably why errors are generally assumed normal in the literature on EB estimation.\n7\n\n4\nNon-Normal-EB estimation\nThe approach presented in this paper builds on both ELL and MR. Like ELL we make no re-\nstrictive assumptions about the error distributions. Unlike ELL however, we also accommodate\nEB estimation. We achieve this by fitting finite normal mixtures (NM) to the error distribu-\ntion functions. Normal mixtures are extremely flexible; they are able to fit any well-behaved\ndistribution function, and are ideally suited for accommodating EB estimation. If the marginal\ndistributions of ua and \u03b5ah can be described by normal mixtures, then the conditional distribu-\ntion too can be described by a normal mixture with known parameters (that are functions of\nthese parameters and of the data on which is being conditioned).\nThere are several other studies that have explored different ways of relaxing the normality\nassumption in mixed linear models.\nVerbeke and Lesaffre (1996) is an early example that\nalso considers normal mixtures as a \u201cnon-parametric\u201d representation of the error distribution\nfunction. However, they impose a number of important restrictions. First, only the area random\neffects ua are allowed to be non-normal; a normal-mixture is fitted to the distribution of ua under\nthe assumption that \u03b5ah is normally distributed. Second, it is assumed that the \u201ccomponent\ndistributions\u201d that make up the normal mixture share a common variance, which noticeably\nsimplifies estimation but at the same time significantly limits the flexibility of the normal\nmixture to fit any given distribution function. This approach has also been followed by Cordy\nand Thomas (1997) who work with the same setup and adopt the same set of restrictions. There\nis another strand of the literature that permits both error terms to be non-normally distributed\nby imposing an alternative parametric family for the distribution functions. See for example\nZhou and He (2008) who fit skewed t-distributions to the nested errors of the linear mixed\nmodel.12 Recently, there have also been efforts to explore the impact of misspecifications in\nthe error distributions for Empirical Bayes predictions derived from linear mixed models, see\nfor example Skrondal and Rabe-Hesketh (2009) and McCulloch and Neuhaus (2011). They\nconclude that the bias is reasonably small. It should be noted however that those studies focus\non prediction of the dependent variable itself, in which case the Empirical Bayes estimates\nof the area random effects ua denote the only source of bias. Misspecifications in the error\ndistributions become considerably more important when predicting nonlinear functions of the\ndependent variable, such as measures of poverty and inequality, as we will show in this paper.\n4.1\nSpecification\nLet us assume that Fu and G\u03b5 can be represented by mixture distributions:\nFu\n=\ni=mu\nX\ni=1\n\u03c0iFi\n(5)\nG\u03b5\n=\nj=m\u03b5\nX\nj=1\n\u03bbjGj,\n(6)\n12Diallo and Rao (2018) relax the normality assumption by considering skew-normal errors.\n8\n\nwhere the Fi\u2019s and Gj\u2019s denote a basis of distribution functions which we will also refer to\nas components or component distribution functions. The \u03c0i\u2019s and \u03bbj\u2019s denote unknown non-\nnegative probabilities that satisfy P\ni \u03c0i = 1 and P\nj \u03bbj = 1, which we will also refer to as\nmixing probabilities.13 mu and m\u03b5 denote the number of components used to represent Fu and\nG\u03b5, respectively. We will denote the probability density functions associated with Fi and Gj by\nrespectively fi and gj.\nMixture distributions are remarkably well equipped to fit any well-behaved distribution\nfunction. For example, kernel density estimators are closely related to mixture distributions.\nWe will be working with normal component distributions, so that the mixture distributions are\nnormal mixtures.\nAssumption 1 The components Fi are normal distribution functions with mean \u00b5i and vari-\nance \u03c32\ni . Similarly, components Gj are normal distribution functions with mean \u03bdj and variance\n\u03c92\nj .\nNote that the modeler is at liberty to work with a different basis of component distributions.\nThis choice does not have real implications for the ability of the mixture to fit a given distribution\nfunction.\nIf p(ua) and p(\u03b5ah) are normal-mixtures, then p(ua|\u00afea) is a normal mixture too. This is a\npowerful result as the integral in equation (3) will generally have to be computed by simulation,\nwhile sampling from normal mixtures is straightforward. Lemma 2 shows how the parameters\nthat define p(ua|\u00afea) can be obtained as a function of the parameters of the normal-mixtures\np(ua) and p(\u03b5ah). Implementing EB estimation is thus as easy as sampling the area errors from\nthe normal-mixture p(ua|\u00afea) whenever \u00afea is observed in the survey sample.\nLemma 2 The probability density function of ua conditional on \u00afea, which we denote by p(ua|\u00afea),\nis a normal-mixture with known parameters:\np(ua|\u00afea) =\ni=mu\nX\ni=1\nj=m\u03b5\nX\nj=1\nk=m\u03b5\nX\nk=1\nwijk\u03c6\n\u0000ua; mijk; s2\nijk\n\u0001\n,\n(7)\nwhere:\nmijk\n=\n \n\u03c32\ni\n\u03c32\ni + (\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk)/na\n!\n(\u00afea \u2212(\u03bdj + \u03bdk)/na) +\n \n\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk\n\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk + na\u03c32\ni\n!\n\u00b5i\ns2\nijk\n=\n \n(\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk)\u03c32\ni\n\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk + na\u03c32\ni\n!\n,\nand where wijk = \u02dcwijk/ P\nijk \u02dcwijk with:\n\u02dcwijk = \u03c0i\u03bbj\u03bbk\u03c6(\u00afea; \u00b5i + (\u03bdj + \u03bdk)/na; \u03c32\ni + (\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk)/na),\n(8)\n13An alternative specification, where a mixture is applied to the full nested error model, is explored in\nBikauskaite et al. (2020). In effect, this assumes that the normal mixture distributions for the area and house-\nhold errors share the same mixing probabilities, rather than specifying flexible normal mixtures for the area- and\nidiosyncratic error distributions separately.\n9\n\nwhere \u03c6 denotes the normal probability density function, and where (\u03c0i, \u00b5i, \u03c32\ni ) and (\u03bbj, \u03bdj, \u03c92\nj )\ndenote the parameters associated with the normal-mixture distributions Fu and G\u03b5, respectively.\nIf we apply the Central Limit Theorem to approximate the marginal distribution of \u00af\u03b5a to a\nnormal distribution with mean zero and variance equal to \u03c32\n\u03b5/na, the expression for p(ua|\u00afea)\nsimplifies considerably:\np(ua|\u00afea) \u2248\ni=mu\nX\ni=1\n\u03b1i\u03c6\n\u0010\nua; \u03b3ai\u00afea + (1 \u2212\u03b3ai)\u00b5i;\n\u00001/\u03c32\ni + na/\u03c32\n\u03b5\n\u0001\u22121\u0011\n,\n(9)\nwith \u03b3ai = \u03c32\ni /(\u03c32\ni + \u03c32\n\u03b5/na), and where \u03b1i = \u02dc\u03b1i/ P\ni \u02dc\u03b1i with:\n\u02dc\u03b1i = \u03c0i\u03c6(\u00afea; \u00b5i; \u03c32\ni + \u03c32\n\u03b5/na).\n(10)\nThe expected value of ua conditional on \u00afea, given the density function p(ua|\u00afea) from Lemma 2,\nis seen to solve:\nE[ua|\u00afea] \u2248\nX\ni\n\u03b1i(\u00afea) (\u03b3ai\u00afea + (1 \u2212\u03b3ai)\u00b5i) ,\n(11)\nwhere \u03b3ai = \u03c32\ni /(\u03c32\ni + \u03c32\n\u03b5/na), and where \u03b1i(\u00afea) denotes the mixing probabilities of p(ua|\u00afea).\nNote that the standard assumption of normal errors is nested as a special case, where there\nis just one component with \u00b5i = 0 and \u03c32\ni = \u03c32\nu.

Estimation of NM to observed\ndata is a routine task. A commonly used method of estimation is the Expectation-Maximization\n(EM) algorithm, which is an iterative method to find local maximum likelihood estimates of\nthe parameters of interest, see e.g. Dempster et al. (1977) and McLachlan and Peel, (2000).\nSuppose that some data y is drawn from a NM with m components and parameter vector \u03b8.\nThe EM algorithm introduces a latent random variable zij that equals 1 if observation yj has\nbeen drawn from component i, and 0 otherwise. Let the log-likelihood function that treats both\n14Note that the unconditional variance solves: var[ua] = var[\u03b3a\u00afea]+(1\u2212\u03b3a)\u03c32\nu = \u03b32\na(\u03c32\nu +\u03c32\n\u03b5/na)+(1\u2212\u03b3a)\u03c32\nu,\nwhich equals var[ua] = \u03b3a\u03c32\nu + (1 \u2212\u03b3a)\u03c32\nu = \u03c32\nu, since \u03c32\nu + \u03c32\n\u03b5/na = \u03c32\nu/\u03b3a.\n10\n\ny and z as data be denoted by L(\u03b8; y, z), and its derivative with respect to \u03b8 by L\u03b8(\u03b8; y, z). The\ncorresponding maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator solves the following moment condition:\nE[L\u03b8(\u03b8; y, z)] = E[E[L\u03b8(\u03b8; y, z)|y]] = 0.\n(14)\nThe EM algorithm essentially solves the same moment condition but iteratively:\nE[E[L\u03b8(\u03b8; y, z)|y, \u02c6\u03b8(k)]] = 0,\n(15)\nwhere \u02c6\u03b8(k) denotes the iteration-k estimate for \u03b8. Solving equation (15) yields \u02c6\u03b8(k+1). The\nprocedure results in a non-decreasing sequence of likelihoods L(y; \u02c6\u03b8k). The advantage of the EM\nalgorithm is that solving equation (15) is often considerably easier than solving equation (14).\nNote that the unobserved data z is integrated out conditional on the observed data y and the\ncurrent estimate of \u03b8.\n5\nSimulation study\n5.1\nSetup\nTo evaluate the relative performance of the different small area estimation methods in realistic\nsettings, we implement a simulation study where the population census and household surveys\nare based on data from actual household income and expenditure surveys across 16 different\ncountries and multiple time periods. Consider the DGP of equation (1) repeated below:\nyah = xah\u03b2 + ua + \u03b5ah.\n(16)\nFor explanation of symbols and assumptions see the discussion following equation (1). The\nDGP specifies three statistically independent determinants of a household\u2019s (log) per capita\nexpenditure or income: a structural or \u2018fixed\u2019 part, xah\u03b2, an area random effect, ua, and an\nhousehold-specific random effect \u03b5ah.\n5.1.1\nFixed part: x\u03b2\nFor the fixed part we use the expected household log per capita income from Brazil\u2019s 2010 census,\nas predicted from linear regression. We argue that this is more appropriate to represent the fixed\npart, with empirically observed cross-area variation, than making arbitrary assumptions on the\ndistribution of xah\u03b2. More specifically we use the data for Minas Gerais from the population\ncensus. This census covers more than 10% of the population. Uniquely, the census includes a\nhousehold income variable. Log per capita household income is regressed on a set of explanatory\nvariables that are commonly included in empirical applications of small area poverty estimation:\nhousehold size, education, age, housing characteristics, assets, access to services, etc. This allows\nus to compute xah \u02c6\u03b2 for all households in the Minas Gerais census sample. At 60% the R2 of\nthe regression is comparatively high but the purpose of the regression is to compile a \u2018fixed\u2019\n11\n\npart of the DGP in equation (1), to be used in otherwise synthetic data. The Minas Gerais\ncensus sample is further limited to municipalities with more than 1000 households in the sample\nresulting in a dataset of 345733 households from 128 municipalities. The municipality means of\nxah \u02c6\u03b2 range from 5.7 to 6.67; the standard deviations range from 0.54 to 0.87.\n5.1.2\nRandom part: ua and \u03b5ah\nThe random parts, the area- and household error ua and \u03b5ah, are based on empirical realizations\nof the errors derived from an inclusive set of income and expenditure regressions that spans 16\ncountries across multiple years, stratified by urban/rural, for a total of 142 surveys. The full\nlist of household surveys used is documented in Appendix section 3. Taking stock of the range\nof error distributions observed in real data across a wide spectrum of different countries and\ntime periods offers a first empirical contribution.\nHenderson\u2019s method III is used to decompose the total residuals in a part common to all\nhouseholds from a given area (the area error term ua) and a household-specific component (the\nidiosyncratic error term \u03b5ah).15 We proceed by estimating non-parametric density functions for\nthe area- and household errors, and subsequently draw ua from the area-level density and \u03b5ah\nfrom the household-level density. Given realizations of both the fixed and random components,\nhousehold log income yah is computed as:\nyah = xah \u02c6\u03b2 + \u03bb1ua + \u03bb2\u03b5ah,\n(17)\nwhere scaling parameters \u03bb1,2 allow us to control the relative size of area and household effects\nin the simulations. The errors ua and \u03b5ah in this case refer to normalized independent random\nvariables with mean zero and unit variance, such that the location effect (share of total error\nvariance due to the area error) equals: s = \u03bb2\n1/(\u03bb2\n1 + \u03bb2\n2). The following shares of the location\neffect are considered: 0, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, and 0.1, which represents the typical range of values\nobserved in poverty mapping applications. A share of 0.1 would be high with the majority\nof empirically observed location shares ranging between 0.02 and 0.08.\nKeeping the size of\nthe location effect fixed across different country-years helps isolate the role of deviations from\nnormality as all variation observed across country-years is purely driven by variation in the\ndegree of non-normality. The overall scale of \u03bb1ua + \u03bb2\u03b5ah is chosen such that a regression\nof yah on xah \u02c6\u03b2 is expected to result in an R2 of 50%, a value typically found with income\nregressions.\nAfter a complete synthetic census of (log) incomes has been generated for households in the\nMinas Gerais census using equation (17), household per capita incomes are then used to classify\nhouseholds as poor or non-poor. From this, we compute area-level poverty head-count rates (in\nterms of households). Two choices of poverty lines are considered. One that yields a headcount\nrate of 12.5 percent and one that yields a rate of 25 percent. The results indicate that this\nchoice is of lesser significance. Particular simulations are defined by poverty line, variance share\n15See P\u00b4erez, Pe\u02dcna and Molina (2011).\n12\n\nof the location effect, country, year and urban status.\n5.1.3\nDrawing of the household survey\nStarting from the census dataset, we draw a balanced sample of households clustered by area\n(i.e., Minas Gerais municipality) with a cluster size of 20 households.\nA key parameter in\nsurvey sampling designs is the share of areas covered by the survey. Increasing this coverage\nwill naturally benefit applications of Empirical Bayes estimation, but will also increase the\ncosts of data collection (by increasing travel costs which constitutes a key component of total\ndata collection costs). In practice this share can be as low as 10 and as high as 100 percent,\nwith higher income countries often opting for higher coverage rates. In the original empirical\napplication to Ecuador by ELL, the coverage rate was 17 percent (and the location effect as\na share of total error is estimated at 0.02). Instead of varying the coverage rate, which would\nintroduce another parameter, we consider the two limiting scenarios: (a) one where all areas are\nincluded in the sample (100 percent coverage), and (b) the other extreme where the number of\nareas covered by the survey is negligible, which is implemented by not employing EB estimation\nin any of the areas. By considering both extremes, we economize on the number of parameters\nto be varied in the simulation study.\nGiven that the focus of this study is on relaxing the normality assumption in applications\nof Empirical Bayes estimation, the sampling design is assumed to be non-informative. Allowing\nfor informative sampling designs, building on the work by e.g., Pfeffermann et al.\n(1998),\nPfeffermann et al. (2006), and Pfeffermann and Sverchkov (2007), is a natural extension that\ncould be considered in future work.\n5.1.4\nSmall area estimation methods\nAll methods work with the same estimates of the fixed part x\u03b2.16\nThey only differ in how\nthe errors ua and \u03b5ah are imputed. These are then combined with the predicted fixed part\nof household log per capita income to yield household-level per capita income and area-level\npoverty predictions.\n1. ELL: This approach is in effect non-normal-non-EB estimation. It was developed for a\ncontext where surveys provide incomplete coverage of small areas in which case the scope\nfor applying Empirical Bayes is reduced. Area effects and household effects are simply\ndrawn (with replacement) from the empirical estimates of ua and \u03b5ah obtained using\nHenderson-method-3 to account for possible non-normality in errors.\n2. Normal-EB: This method assumes that ua and \u03b5ah are normally distributed.\nWe as-\nsume zero mean distributions for the error components with variances as estimated by\nHenderson-method-3. Area effects are drawn conditionally on the residuals for survey\nhouseholds.\n16The coefficient estimates \u03b2 used to impute the fixed part are subject to sampling error due to the particular\nsurvey that has been drawn.\n13\n\n3. Non-normal-EB: Like ELL this method draws each household effects directly (with re-\nplacement) from the estimated idiosyncratic errors. Area effects ua are drawn from a\nconditional normal mixture according to Lemma 2. Conditioning is on the estimated area\ncomponent for each area.\nAnother candidate method is to resample total errors per area. Since there are as many\nas 20 households per area in the survey, it would be interesting to see if simply resampling\ntotal regression residuals per area (i.e., not attempting to split residuals in area and household\ncomponents) performs well. It has the additional advantage of being robust to heteroskedasticity\nof error components across areas. We implemented this approach but do not report results for\nthis method. While it outperforms ELL it is inferior to non-normal-EB, which is the main focus\nof this study.\n5.1.5\nEstimation of normal mixture distributions\nObtaining estimates of the conditional normal mixtures for the area errors used in the non-\nnormal-EB method involves two steps. First, fit a normal mixture to the estimated area errors\nua (i.e., estimate the unconditional area error distribution). Second, apply Lemma 2, which\nuses the estimated unconditional normal-mixture as an input, to obtain estimates of the con-\nditional normal mixtures for the area errors. For the estimation of the unconditional normal\nmixture distributions to the area errors, we adopt the EM algorithm. Identifying the number\nof components can require experimentation. To avoid this we have automated the search for\nmixtures, which involves fitting normal mixtures with 1, 2, and 3 components, as follows:17\na. As initial values use for the means 0 in the case of 1 component, -1 and 1 in the case of 2\ncomponents, and -1, 0, and 1 in the case of 3 components\nb. Run the EM algorithm until convergence or stop after 1000 iterations\nc. Integrate absolute difference between the estimated density function and the kernel density\nfunction of the normal-mixture approximation\nd. Choose the normal mixture with the smallest difference\nThis automated procedure facilitates application across the large number of different surveys.\nAlthough this yields satisfactory approximations it can be argued that better approximations\ncan be achieved with more sophisticated strategies (or tailoring specification to dataset at\nhand). In that sense whatever advantage our simulation method has over the other approaches\ncan be considered a lower bound. Alternatively, one could consider restricting the variance of\nthe components distributions to be the same across components and offset this restriction by\nincreasing the number of components (akin to fitting a kernel density). The results obtained\nwith this choice of normal mixture estimator (not reported here) are practically identical.\n17Note that 1 component corresponds to a normal distribution.\n14\n\n5.1.6\nPerformance metric\nAll methods impute log per capita incomes at the household level, which translates to area-level\nhead-count rates and, by comparison with the \u2018actual\u2019 head-count rates from the synthetic cen-\nsus, an overall Mean Squared Error (MSE). This study focuses on overall aggregate performance\nof the methods. A single survey is drawn from the synthetic census for each imputation, which\nis repeated 100 times.\nFor each area, the 100 imputations yield an average simulated head-count poverty rate,\n\u02c6\u00b5a, which is compared to the \u2018true\u2019 poverty rate \u00b5a from the synthetic census.\nOur main\nperformance indicator is the MSE of \u02c6\u00b5a. Let na be the number of households in area a and\nN = P\na na, then:\nMSE = 1\nN\nX\na\nna(\u02c6\u00b5a \u2212\u00b5a)2.\n(18)\nA version of the MSE where areas are not population weighted is also implemented. This\nyields nearly identical results.\n5.2\nEmpirically observed error distributions\nLet us first take stock of the empirical distributions for the area and household errors that\nare observed across the 142 different surveys (from 16 different counties spanning multiple\nyears). The degree of non-normality is evaluated through estimates of the skewness and kurtosis.\nFigure 1 plots the kernel densities for the estimated skewness and kurtosis of ua and \u03b5ah,\nrespectively.\nThe estimated moments point to significant deviations from normality (when\nskewness is zero and kurtosis 3), especially for the household idiosyncratic component. The\nskewness of area errors ranges between -1 and 1, and kurtosis from 2 to 8, disregarding outliers.\nHousehold errors have skewness ranging from -1.5 to 1.5 and kurtosis from 4 to 10.\nFigure 1: Kernel density for skewness (left) and kurtosis (right)\nThe empirical relationship between the moments for the area- and the household-error com-\nponents are shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that the two moments exhibit an U-shaped\nrelationship, with minimum kurtosis if skewness is around zero.\nWe can similarly verify whether the moments of the area error are correlated with the\nmoments of the household error, i.e., whether a skewed (or heavy tailed) household error tends\n15\n\nFigure 2: Kurtosis versus skewness for area errors (left) and idiosyncratic errors (right)\nto coincide with a skewed (or heavy tailed) area error.\nFigure 3 confirms that skewness of\nhousehold and area errors show a positive association. In summary, for the majority of surveys,\nthe empirically observed error distributions show significant deviations from normality.18\nFigure 3: Household error versus area error moments: skewness (left) and kurtosis (right)\n5.3\nSmall area estimation results\nNormal-EB is expected to do well when the location effect is comparatively large and the degree\nof non-normality is small, while ELL is expected to do well when the location effect is small and\nthe degree of non-normality is large. Non-normal-EB is expected to do well in either scenario.\nOur simulations confirm these expectations.\nBy considering different values of the location\neffect and varying degrees of non-normality, we can assess at what point ELL and normal-EB\nare at par.\nFigure 4 plots the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) against the degree of non-normality of\nerrors as measured by skewness of the idiosyncratic error in the case of a 12.5 headcount poverty\nrate.19 The graphs are smoothed summaries of simulation results obtained by fitting kernel\n18A Shapiro-Wilk normality test is rejected in all cases for the household error components and in 72% of the\ncases for the area components (p=0.05).\n19Given that the moments of the individual error and moments of the area error are highly correlated, our figures\neffectively show how RMSE varies with non-normality in errors (without isolating non-normality in individual\nerrors from non-normality in area errors).\nHaving said that, our results show what gains in RMSE one can\nreasonably expect in practical settings using empirically observed error distributions across a wide range of\ncountries, where non-normality in individual errors and area errors are seen to co-vary.\n16\n\nregressions. Note that normal and ELL represent the counter-parts of normal-EB and non-\nnormal-EB for areas that are not covered by the survey. Estimates of the RMSE corresponding\nto a headcount poverty rate of 25 percent are presented in Appendix section 4.\nOur results indicate that ELL outperforms normal-EB when the location effect is near-zero\nand errors are non-normally distributed, while normal-EB is seen to significantly outperforms\nELL when the location effect is comparatively large (non-normality of errors notwithstanding).\nThe two approaches are found to be at par for location effects in the range of 2.5 \u22125 percent\n(with upper range corresponding to cases with higher degrees of non-normality observed in\nempirical data). ELL\u2019s advantage dissipates quickly when location effects are more important.\nFigure 4 shows this for a location variance share of as little as 2.5%. Also, note that (as one\nwould expect) RMSE is very sensitive to location effects, increasing more than threefold across\nthe different choices of the location effect shares. Finally, the results obtained for the poverty\nthat yields a headcount rate of 25 percent, which are qualitatively identical, are included in\nAppendix section 4.\nOur estimates also confirm that non-normal-EB records the lowest RMSE in all cases. The\ndifference (in RMSE) when compared to normal-EB is however comparatively marginal at higher\nlevels of the location effect. Similarly, the difference is marginal when compared to ELL at\nnear-zero levels of the location effect. By the same token, there is no downside to adopting\nnon-normal-EB. The gains of non-normal-EB over normal-EB and ELL are between marginal\nand notable, but never negative.\nFigure 4: RMSE versus skewness for different magnitudes of the location effect (as a percentage\nof total error)\n17\n\nOne notable feature shown in Figure 4 is that negative skewness tends to result in sizable\ndifferences in RMSE, more than a positive skewness does. With kurtosis we see the difference\nincrease if kurtosis is increasing. Such patterns are driven by the step nature of the headcount\nas a function of income on the one hand, and on the other hand by the distribution of x\u03b2, the\npoverty line and the actual skewness (and other moments) of the error distributions used in the\nsimulations. There is therefore no reason to expect that for e.g. skewness the pattern should be\nsymmetric.\nTo explore the different effects of positive and negative skewness we let skewness range from\n-0.453 to 0.453 by mixing a density estimator p\u03b5(\u03b5) of the individual residuals from Bangladesh\n(rural Bangladesh survey from 2000) with a normal distribution as follows:\npmix(\u03b5; \u03bb) = |\u03bb|p\u03b5(sign(\u03bb)\u03b5) + (1 \u2212|\u03bb|)pnorm(\u03b5),\n(19)\nand letting \u03bb range between -1 (corresponding to skewness -0.453) and +1 (skewness +0.453).\nThe average difference (weighted by x\u03b2 frequencies) between skewed and normal poverty prob-\nabilities is graphed in Figure 5 (left panel), showing indeed a larger difference for negative\nskewness. The overall squared difference is pictured in Figure 5 (right panel), with the same\nconclusion.\nFigure 5: Effect of skewness on expected headcount poverty\n6\nConcluding remarks\nNormal-EB prediction is expected to do well relative to ELL (non-normal-non-EB prediction)\nwhen: (i) the area error makes up a significant share of total error, (ii) the errors exhibit\nmodest deviations from normality, and (iii) the household survey covers a large share of the\ntotal number of target areas. Using a large-scale simulation study based on actual household\nsurvey data from 142 different survey rounds across 16 different countries, thereby working\nwith empirically relevant error distributions, we can confirm this prediction. In cases where\nthe location effect makes up 5 percent or more of total error, normal-EB will outperform ELL\n(i.e., achieve lower RMSE) for all empirically observed degrees of non-normality. In those cases\nwhere the location effect is comparatively small and the deviations from normality are more\n18\n\nmeaningful however, the ordering may be reversed.\nThe non-normal-EB approach put forward in this paper is expected to do well in either of the\ndifferent scenarios described above. This too is confirmed in the simulation study. Depending\non the scenario, the increase in precision of non-normal-EB relative to both normal-EB and\nELL can range from meaningful (up to a 15-25 percent reduction in RMSE) to negligible (near-\nzero reduction in RMSE), but it is always positive. Given that the proposed non-normal-EB\napproach is furthermore easy to implement, there is no downside to using it. Note that the\napproach is equally relevant for survey-to-survey prediction, where similar improvements in\nprecision may be expected.\nAn alternative means for handling non-normality in errors is to consider transformations of\nthe dependent variable such that the transformed variable is more normally distributed, see for\nexample Rojas Perilla et al. (2020) and the references therein. An investigation into combining\nthis approach with the one presented in this paper is something that could be explored in future\nresearch. Another potential avenue for future research is to extend non-normal-EB estimation\nto non-linear models such as logistic regression models (see e.g., Farrell, 1997) and multiple\nregression contexts (see e.g., Isaki, 1990).\nReferences\nAraujo, M., Ferreira, F., Lanjouw, P. and Ozler, B.

Let v3 = v1 + v2. Denote the normal density function with expectation \u00b5 and\nvariance \u03c32 by \u03c6(\u00b7; \u00b5, \u03c3). Then for the joint density p(v1, v3) and the conditional density p(v1|v3)\nwe have\np(v1, v3)\n=\n\u03c6(v1; \u00b51, \u03c31)\u03c6(v3 \u2212v1; \u00b52, \u03c32)\n=\np(v1|v3)p(v3)\n=\n\u03c6\n \nv1;\n\u03c32\n1\n\u03c32\n1 + \u03c32\n2\n(v3 \u2212\u00b52) +\n\u03c32\n2\n\u03c32\n1 + \u03c32\n2\n\u00b51,\n\u03c31\u03c32\np\n\u03c32\n1 + \u03c32\n2\n!\n\u00d7\u03c6\n\u0012\nv3; \u00b51 + \u00b52,\nq\n\u03c32\n1 + \u03c32\n2\n\u0013\n.\nProof\nThis can be directly verified. Alternatively, note that both v3 and v1|v3 are normally\ndistributed. The distribution of v1|v3 has expectation\nE(v1|v3) =\n\u03c32\n1\n\u03c32\n1 + \u03c32\n2\n(v3 \u2212\u00b52) +\n\u03c32\n2\n\u03c32\n1 + \u03c32\n2\n\u00b51\nand variance\nvar (v1|v3) =\n\u03c32\n1\u03c32\n2\n\u03c32\n1 + \u03c32\n2\n.\n\u25a1\nCorollary 4 Let x and y be independent random variables distributed as normal mixtures, and\nlet q = x + y. Then (i) q is also distributed as a normal mixture, and (ii) the conditional\ndistributions p(x|q) and p(y|q) are also normal mixtures. Moreover, the mixing parameters of\np(q), p(x|q) and p(y|q) are closed expressions in terms of the distributional parameters of x and\ny. In particular, if the density function of x is\nf(x) =\na\nX\nk=1\n\u03c0k\u03c6(x; \u00b5k, \u03c3k),\n(with \u03c0k > 0 and P\nk \u03c0k = 1) and the density function of y is\ng(y) =\nb\nX\nj=1\n\u03bbj\u03c6(y; \u03bdj, \u03c4j),\n(with \u03bbj > 0 and P\nj \u03bbj = 1) then the conditional distribution of x, given q is\nh(x|q) =\nX\njk\n\u03bajk\u03c6(x; mjk, sjk),\n24\n\nwhere the mixing probabilities \u03bajk are proportional to\n\u03bajk \u221d\u03c0k\u03bbj\u03c6\n\u0010\nq; \u00b5k + \u03bdj,\nq\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\n\u0011\nand\nmjk\n=\n\u03c32\nk\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\n(q \u2212\u03bdj) +\n\u03c4 2\nj\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\n\u00b5k\ns2\njk\n=\n\u03c32\nk\u03c4 2\nj\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\nProof\nThe random variable x can be expressed as\nx =\na\nX\nk=1\nzkxk,\nwhere the xk are independent (latent) random variables, and also independent of (z1, ..., za). xk\nis normally distributed according to component distribution k, with density \u03c6(xk; \u00b5k, \u03c3k). The\nzks are indicator random variables taking values 0 and 1 with probability \u03c0k. One and only one\nindicator takes the value 1, the others are 0.20 Likewise y can be expressed as\nx =\nb\nX\nj=1\nwjyj,\nwhere the (wj, yj) independent of the (zk, xk). Note that zk = zk\nP\nj wj and wj = wj\nP\nk zk, so\nthat\nq = x + y =\nX\nk\nzkxk +\nX\nj\nwjyj =\nX\njk\nzkwj(xk + yj).\nPart (i) of the Corollary now immediately follows; the mixing probabilities for q are P[zkwj =\n1] = \u03c0k\u03bbj and the component distribution for component (k, j) has expectation \u00b5k + \u03bdj and\nvariance \u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj .\nFor the conditional distribution p(x|q) we have\np(x|q)\n\u221d\np(x, q)\n=\nX\njk\n\u03c0k\u03bbj\u03c6(x; \u00b5k, \u03c3k)\u03c6(q \u2212x; \u03bdj, \u03c4j)\n=\nX\njk\n\u03c0k\u03bbj\u03c6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edx;\n\u03c32\nk\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\n(q \u2212\u03bdj) +\n\u03c4 2\nj\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\n\u00b5k,\n\u03c3k\u03c4j\nq\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\n\u00d7\u03c6\n\u0010\nq; \u00b5k + \u03bdj,\nq\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\n\u0011\n.\nThe last equality follows from the Lemma.\n20In other words, the (z1, ..., za) have a multinomial distribution with class probabilities \u03c0k and a single draw.\n25\n\nThe conditional distribution p(x|q) is therefore again a normal mixture with mixing proba-\nbilities for the (k, j) component proportional to\n\u03c0k\u03bbj\u03c6\n\u0010\nq; \u00b5k + \u03bdj,\nq\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\n\u0011\nand corresponding component distribution\n\u03c6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8edx;\n\u03c32\nk\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\n(q \u2212\u03bdj) +\n\u03c4 2\nj\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\n\u00b5k,\n\u03c3k\u03c4j\nq\n\u03c32\nk + \u03c4 2\nj\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f8.\nThe distribution of p(y|q) follows in exactly the same fashion.\n\u25a1\nAppendix 2\nProofs\nLemma 2: The probability density function of ua conditional on \u00afea, which we denote by\np(ua|\u00afea), is a normal-mixture with known parameters:\np(ua|\u00afea) =\ni=mu\nX\ni=1\nj=m\u03b5\nX\nj=1\nk=m\u03b5\nX\nk=1\nwijk\u03c6\n\u0000ua; mijk; s2\nijk\n\u0001\n,\n(20)\nwhere:\nmijk\n=\n \n\u03c32\ni\n\u03c32\ni + (\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk)/na\n!\n(\u00afea \u2212(\u03bdj + \u03bdk)/na) +\n \n\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk\n\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk + na\u03c32\ni\n!\n\u00b5i\ns2\nijk\n=\n \n(\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk)\u03c32\ni\n\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk + na\u03c32\ni\n!\n,\nand where wijk = \u02dcwijk/ P\nijk \u02dcwijk with:\n\u02dcwijk = \u03c0i\u03bbj\u03bbk\u03c6(\u00afea; \u00b5i + (\u03bdj + \u03bdk)/na; \u03c32\ni + (\u03c92\nj + \u03c92\nk)/na),\n(21)\nwhere \u03c6 denotes the normal probability density function, and where (\u03c0i, \u00b5i, \u03c32\ni ) and (\u03bbj, \u03bdj, \u03c92\nj )\ndenote the parameters associated with the normal-mixture distributions Fu and G\u03b5, respectively.\nProof\nThe result stated in this lemma follows from a direct application of Corollary 4.\n\u25a1\nAppendix 3\nHousehold surveys used for random components\n3.1\nData sources\nThe household income and expenditure survey data used to obtain estimates of the area and\nhousehold level random components across a wide range of countries and years are listed in\nTable 1.
