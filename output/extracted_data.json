      "1": "# Abstract \n\nSince the industrial revolution, the economic development of Western Europe and North America was characterized by continuous urbanization accompanied by a gradual phasing-in of urban land property rights over time. Today, however, the evidence in many fast urbanizing low-income countries points towards a different trend of \"urbanization without formalization\", with potentially adverse effects on long-term economic growth. This paper aims to understand the causes and the consequences of this phenomenon, and whether informal city growth could be a transitory or a persistent feature of developing economies. A dynamic stochastic equilibrium model of a representative city is developed, which explicitly accounts for the joint dynamics\nof land property rights and urbanization. The calibrated baseline model describes a city that first grows informally, with the growth of individual incomes leading to a phasedin purchase of property rights in subsequent periods. The model demonstrates that land tenure informality does not necessarily vanish in the long term, and the social optimum does not necessarily imply a fully formal city, neither in the transition, nor in the long run. The welfare effects of policies, such as reducing the cost of land tenure formalization, or protecting informal dwellers against evictions are subsequently investigated, throughout the short-term transition and in the long-term stationary state.\n\nThis paper is a product of the Environment and Energy Team, Development Research Group.

      "3": "# 1 Introduction \n\nOver the past two centuries, the world has witnessed unprecedented changes in the form of massive population growth, continuous urbanization, and economic development. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution (1760-1840), countries in Western Europe and North America began to shift from agrarian towards industrialized societies. This involved migration from rural areas to cities, which, combined with a decline in urban mortality, caused urban populations to grow at an unprecedented pace. As a result, urbanization rates began to pick up steadily. The proportion of people residing in cities increased dramatically over that period, starting from a low rate of approximately one-tenth throughout the Middle Ages and the early modern period (Bairoch 1988) and reaching today 81.5 percent in North America and 73.4 percent in Europe (United Nations, 2014). Simultaneously, North America and Western Europe experienced unprecedented economic development as urbanization accompanied a profound structural transformation of their economies whereby employment in the agricultural sector decreased and a large manufacturing sector emerged in cities (Bairoch and Goertz 1986, Michaels et al. 2012). At the same time, declining transport costs facilitated trade between cities, which further stimulated industrial growth. To the extent that cities also facilitated innovation, in particular through dynamic knowledge and human capital externalities (Lucas 1988, Romer 1990, Glaeser et al. 1992, Black and Henderson 1999, Bertinelli and Black 2004), it is fair to say that they acted as engines of growth (Henderson 2005 and 2010, Quigley 2009). The dynamics of urbanization both stimulated and were accelerated by economic development. Urban population growth contributed to increase labor productivity (and thus income) thanks to pervasive and significant agglomeration effects whereby workers become more productive when cities become larger (Duranton, 2014a). This positive relation is represented on the cross-sectional graph plotting per capita GDP against the urbanization rate for 189 countries (see Figure 1, Panel A below). In accordance with this graph, it is roughly estimated that a one percentage point increase in the urbanization rate is associated with a five point increase in per capita gross domestic product (see Duranton 2014b). A similar relation emerges when plotting U.N. estimates of per capita production for a cross section of large cities against the corresponding country's urbanization rate (see Figure 1, Panel B below). The latter graph suggests that cities tend to be more productive in countries which are more urbanized.\n\nSeveral authors contend that these evolutions in the cities of Western Europe and North America were made possible by the emergence of institutions conducive to economic growth (North 1990 and 1991, Chong and Calderón 2000), such as financial development (Bondenhorm and Cuberes 2010), the degree of democratization (Henderson and Wang 2007), and property rights (Acemoglu et al. 2005). Improvement in land property rights, in particular, played a crucial role as it favored the development of manufacturing activities by lowering transaction costs for the transfer of land to the emerging industries that were locating in cities and by making investments not only more secure but also more productive (Knack and Keefer 1995). By stimulating the development of",

      "5": "impersonal markets (Arruñada 2012) and enabling the reallocation of land to more productive uses, institutions defining and facilitating the enforcement of land property rights very likely improved economic efficiency (as argued by Coase 1960 and Demsetz 1967). Even though only a few empirical studies investigated the role played by property rights on urban development, these studies all consistently point towards a significant and positive effect. DeLong and Shleifer (1993) estimate that during the 800 years prior to the Industrial Revolution, West European cities in which property rights were more secure-because they were ruled by an elite made of merchants rather than princes-grew faster than other cities. Acemoglu et al. (2005) show that both urbanization and income growth occurred faster in West European countries than in East European countries because of the emergence of property rights institutions in the former group of countries that served the interests of Atlantic trade between 1500 and the Industrial Revolution. Looking at population density in Britain in the decades surrounding the industrial revolution (between 1660 and 1830), Bogart and Richardson (2009) show that the counties where the transfer of property rights were facilitated by Acts of Parliament experienced faster urbanization. ${ }^{1}$\n\nIt is important to note that the emergence or reform of property rights institutions is in many instances endogenous and responds to the changing economic context. In theory, property rights institutions will emerge or be strengthened as the benefits of property rights increase (Demsetz 1967, Anderson and Hill 1975, Bubb 2013) and as the political groups that benefit from property rights become sufficiently powerful to weigh in on the legal and institutional framework governing property rights (Libecap 1986, Feder and Feeny 1991). In the historic examples that we already mentioned, this is illustrated by the pressure exerted by Atlantic traders in Western Europe post 1500 to improve institutions that facilitated their activities (Acemoglu et al. 2005) or, in the specific context of Great Britain around the Industrial Revolution, by the public demand for Parliament acts to simplify rules governing land inheritance (Richardson and Bogart 2008). Both in Western Europe and North America, however, the emergence of efficient urban land property rights institutions took considerable time and property rights were only progressively phased in (Konig 1974), possibly due to various political, technical and economic constraints. The political constraints that hindered the development of property rights systems mainly involved the opposition of landowners to registration because of their fear of increased taxation (Offer 1981, Bourillon et al. 2008). It has been theorized, more generally, that landowners may have opposed any form of public protection of property rights (Sonin 2003) as they favored private and selective enforcement of property rights-for which they had a comparative advantage-over public enforcement mechanisms (Kerekes and Williamson, 2010). In addition to such political factors, technical challenges also played an important role in delaying the completion of functioning land property rights systems as illustrated by the repeated attempts over different centuries to establish a complete cadaster in France where manually mapping properties remained extremely costly and time-consuming until the 19th century (Bourillon et al. 2008). Last but not least, a large\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ The authors focus on \"estate acts\" which relaxed \"strict settlements\" whereby land had to descend intact from one generation to the other and was encumbered by a complex system of assignment of stipends to relatives.",
      "6": "part of the demand for property rights may have been constrained by the high costs of access to property rights (e.g. registration fees) until a decrease in the costs or until economic development and the ensuing increases in wealth made property rights affordable to a large fraction, if not all the population. ${ }^{2}$\n\nIt is clear that the dynamic process of urbanization and the development of urban land property rights systems have been intertwined, with emerging property rights institutions facilitating urbanization and, in turn, with urbanization creating the conditions for further improvements of property rights institutions and for the dissemination of property rights. These dynamics are illustrated by the spatial expansion of European cities which often occurred outside the jurisdiction of the existing property rights system until coverage of the system was later extended to these areas or until the demand for property rights in these areas was expressed and met. In this context, residential informality (defined as the lack of formal property rights) initially rose with the spatial expansion of the city before being progressively resorbed over time. Today, nearly all urban dwellers hold a property right in the cities of the developed world.\n\nThere are important differences, however, when comparing the process of urbanization and evolution of land property rights systems in developing countries to that of North America and Western Europe. First, the timing and pace of urbanization turned out to be different in the developing world. Contrary to Western Europe and North America, it is only in the twentieth century that developing countries began to urbanize (see Figure 2), with a pace of urbanization that proved much higher than that of earlier industrializing countries at similar stages of urbanization. Strikingly, Latin America rapidly caught up with developed countries and is now more urbanized than Europe (with 79.5 percent of the Latin America's population residing in cities). As for the Middle East, it has been more than half urban for more than three decades. Today, only Asia and Africa remain predominantly rural (with respective urbanization rates of 47.5 and 40.0 percent). It is in these still predominantly rural regions, however, that the urban population is growing at the fastest rate, with many large cities growing by 4 or 5 percent annually. ${ }^{3}$ In Africa, in particular, as a result of these high population growth rates, the urban population is expected to increase almost threefold over the next 35 years, reaching 1.3 billion inhabitants in total. This will raise tremendous challenges for African cities as their net population gain is expected to outweigh in just 35 years the current urban population of Europe and North America combined.\n\nSecond, in many parts of the developing world, dysfunctional urban land property rights systems continue to prevail (Durand-Lasserve and Selod, 2009). In African cities in particular, the inconsistent and inappropriate legal frameworks governing land, the poor capacity of land administrations, the lack of political will to reform land laws and practices, and the lucrative\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ In different country contexts, it is often the case that the cost of accessing property rights is inflated by the rent capture behaviors of land administrations or by \"palliative\" service industries (e.g. lawyers, notaries) who favor dysfunctional systems that increase the demand for their own service (Offer 1981, Arruñada 2012).\n    ${ }^{3}$ Most of this growth originates from rural urban migration as two thirds of the growth can be attributed to migration to cities and only one third to natural growth (see Jedwab et al. 2015).",

      "8": "rent-seeking behavior of numerous stakeholders in the land sector combine to prevent large fractions of the population from accessing land under secure property rights (Durand-Lasserve et al. 2015). In this context, informal settlements have become a key feature of urbanization in developing countries, reflecting both the low income levels and the institutional weaknesses of these countries. In Sub-Saharan Africa in particular, it is believed that between 60 and 80 percent of the urban population live in informal settlements (UN-Habitat 2010). As informal settlements are very often slums ${ }^{4}$, they may hinder the economic development of cities and exacerbate poverty through a variety of channels including lack of investment in education (Benabou 1993), adverse labor market outcomes (Rospabé and Selod 2006), high criminality (Glaeser and Sims 2015), and a negative impact on health (Sclar et al. 2006). The lack of formal land property rights in informal settlements further immobilizes capital that is \"locked\" and cannot be used for productive activities (de Soto 2000, Safavian et al. 2006). ${ }^{5}$ More generally, distorted land markets in cities are a major source of inefficiency that hinder economic activities (Duranton et al. 2015). As a result, some countries (mostly African ones) are urbanizing with insecure land rights and in the absence of economic growth. ${ }^{6}$\n\nIn view of all the above, the key question raised in our paper is the extent to which the dynamics of urbanization in developing countries will replicate or will diverge from the experience of North America and Western Europe. It is indeed not clear a priori whether the combination of rapid urbanization with distorted property rights systems will affect the timing of urbanization and growth along a path that is comparable to that of industrialized countries, or, on the contrary, if it will set developing economies on a different path of \"messy urbanization\" with persisting slums and limited long-run economic growth. Projecting the experience of North America and Western Europe onto urbanization in the developing world, there seems to be an implicit consensus among development experts that the first scenario will be happening. In this respect, the \"modernization\" view of slums sees them as transitory (Marx et al. 2013) and bound to disappear with increases in income as in the case of developed countries: slums, which were quite common in 19th century cities in Europe (Offer 1981), have become almost inexistent in the cities of developed countries. Figure 3 (Panel A) plots the percentage of urban dwellers living in slums on the urbanization rate for a selection of developing countries. In support of this assumption, it shows a negative cross-sectional relation, and thus suggests that the pursuit of urbanization will indeed reduce slums. Similarly, longitudinal data over a short time period ( 15 years) also indicate a decrease in the prevalence of slums in almost all the countries in the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ There is a high correlation between informal settlements and slums. The UN definition of slums includes a high prevalence of households residing under insecure tenure due to weak property rights as one of the possible criteria that determine slums.\n    ${ }^{5}$ De Soto's intuition that real property rights should enable their holders to use their property as collateral to obtain credit rests on the assumptions that low-income households in slums are credit constrained and that financial institutions would agree to provide mortgage credit to these households and would accept their properties as collateral (Woodruff 2001).\n    ${ }^{6}$ See Fay and Opal (2000) for the seminal paper identifying the puzzle of \"urbanization without growth\", and Jedwab (2015) for an explanation based on the resource curse leading to the development of \"consumption cities\" that do not trigger a virtuous circle of industrialization.",

      "10": "The likelihood of the first scenario to occur, however, hinges upon the assumption that property rights will continue to become increasingly accessible (as evidenced by Figure 3, Panel B), either under existing institutions or because improved institutions will emerge and facilitate access to property rights. Whereas much progress has been achieved to improve land governance in the developing world (see Deininger et al. 2012), some countries seem to be marred in a status quo of inadequate property rights systems and are unable to push forward institutional reforms in the land sector. There are a number of reasons for this inertia. As noted by North (1990), bad institutional systems can persist over time with the creation of new organizations that have no incentive to create more efficient rules. Moving away from weak property rights systems may be difficult as those who benefit from the weaknesses (e.g., palliative service industries or land grabbers) exercise political clout to prevent reforms. Weak property rights systems may also persist given path dependency in the building of property rights institutions (Libecap et al. 2011, Arruñada 2012). The specific context of high inequality and corruption in developing countries may further make the collective design and enforcement of adequate property rights systems particularly problematic. Even when appropriate legal frameworks are in place, the degree of enforcement of property rights may be weak (Coase 1960, Firmin-Sellers 1995) or the pricing of property rights can be excessive in comparison with private benefits (Feder and Feeny 1991), limiting the \"take up\" of property rights.\n\nThese observations imply that different paths are possible. In the case of countries which, for some reason, have reached efficient land property rights institutions, can it be anticipated that urbanization will lead to a virtuous circle where a functioning land market with secure property rights will enable growth-enhancing agglomeration? For countries with inefficient land property rights institutions, will the same occur with a delay? Or will these economies follow a different urbanization trajectory with limited growth and persisting slums over the long run?\n\nTo our knowledge, the joint dynamics of urbanization and of the evolution of land property rights has not been studied. The small empirical literature on urban property rights has mainly been concerned with assessing the capitalization of characteristics associated with formal vs. informal land tenure such as tenure security (Jimenez 1982 and 1984, Friedman et al. 1998, Kim 2004) or transferability (Lanjouw and Levy 2002), or on measuring the effect of formalization (i.e. transforming informal into formal tenure) on a variety of social and economic outcomes including increased labor market participation, reduced child labor, housing improvement, health, and the facilitation of market transactions (see Field 2005 and 2007, Field and Torero 2006, Galiani and Schargrodsky 2010, Macours et al. 2010). As for the emerging theoretical literature, it has mainly been concerned with explaining the demand for informal land tenure. In the wake of Jimenez (1985), a series of papers have explained how squatting can be sustained in an equilibrium where eviction may occur with some probability (Jimenez 1985, Hoy and Jimenez 1991, Turnbull 2008) or where eviction is absent as squatters take action to guard against eviction (Brueckner and",
      "11": "Selod 2009, Brueckner 2013, Shah 2014). ${ }^{7}$ Departing from the restricted focus on squatters, Selod and Tobin (2015) model the formalization choices of households in a context where land plots may be appropriated by others due to multiple sales. In their model, higher endogenous land prices in the core city provide greater incentives to formalize than at the periphery. Because all these models are static-with the only exception of Turnbull (2008), who explores the strategic choices of landowners regarding the timing of squatter eviction-none of them accounts for the transformation of property rights over time under evolving land prices.\n\nOur paper fills this important gap by proposing a theory that accounts for the joint dynamics of urbanization and the evolution of property rights. We model urbanization through the migration of heterogeneous agents from a representative rural area to a representative city. The prevalence of land tenure informality is determined by urban dwellers' decisions whether and when to purchase a property right. As land prices increase with agglomeration, formalization becomes more desirable. However, formalizing may be too costly for less productive workers. These workers who may not be able to afford both a land plot and a land title, will postpone the decision to formalize, making themselves potential prey to land grabbers. The model can flexibly account for the variety of situations regarding urbanization dynamics as its behavior critically depends on key parameters regarding institutional quality (the cost and enforcement strength of land property rights), the potential for agglomeration effects, and macroeconomic uncertainty. Contrary to the modernization view of slums, and in line with the observation that \"informality may be here to stay\", it allows us to exhibit plausible contexts in which land tenure informality remains in the long run. Deconstructing common-sense intuitions, the model also sheds lights on situations where some level of informality is actually socially desirable. This is because, under the parameters of the economy, informality provides access to the city to low income workers who would not be able to contribute to the urban economy under compulsory formal property rights. In this context, enforcement of strict eviction policies would be counter-productive. The model also provides insights into leaving urbanization to the market, which can be suboptimal under adverse structural parameters, in particular when the potential for agglomeration is low and when land administration charge high fees.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 below presents the model which takes the form of a discrete-time dynamic stochastic game under infinite time but a finite number of states and actions. Section 3 then presents our concepts of social planner and decentralized solutions. Section 4 explains our calibration before Section 5 presents the main results from simulations.\n\n# 2 The model \n\nWe consider an economy with a set of $N$ individuals. Individuals live forever and may either reside in the rural area or in the city. In the city, individuals are exposed to a risk of conflict\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ For a detailed survey, see Brueckner and Lall (2014).",
      "12": "over land that may result in their eviction from the plot they occupy (a \"land grab\"). Urban dwellers can nevertheless pay to establish a property right on their plot instead of holding it informally. Whereas informally holding a plot does not provide tenure security, formally held plots are protected against land grabs and their owners cannot be evicted. Formally, let us denote $x_{t}^{i}=\\left(x_{t}^{U, i}, x_{t}^{F, i}\\right)$ the vector of state variables for a representative individual $i$ at time t . $x_{t}^{U, i}$ is the location variable for individual $i$. It takes value 1 if the household resides in the urban area and 0 if the individual resides in the rural area at time $t . x_{t}^{F, i}$ is the property right variable. $x_{t}^{F, i}$ takes value 1 if the household holds a property right at time $t$ and 0 otherwise. We assume that property rights can only be obtained in the urban area so that living in the rural area with a property right is never a possibility in the model. ${ }^{8}$\n\nWhen living in the city over the period $(t, t+1)$, the individual $i$ earns a wage $w_{t}^{U, i}$ for his work during the period but faces a congestion costs $c_{t}$, which we assume to be the same for all individuals. If residing in the rural area, the individual earns rural income $w_{t}^{R}$ which we assume is the same for all rural dwellers. ${ }^{9}$ There is no congestion cost in the rural area. Wages and the urban congestion cost will be endogenous in the model. In addition, if settling in the city at time $t$, an individual must purchase a land plot at a price $R_{t}$ on the land market. Although the price of land is endogenous in the city, because land is abundant in the rural area, we assume for simplicity that the price of land in the rural area is equal to zero without any loss of generality. ${ }^{10}$\n\nIn our dynamic setting, the land price in the city is determined at the beginning of each period by a macro-economic relation that accounts for city composition and economic conditions (see below). The prevailing land price then drives location choices and grabbing decisions within the period, which in turn affects the fundamentals of the land price for the next period. We assume that there are absentee landlords who, in each period, sell land to urban in-migrants upon arrival to the city and purchase it from voluntary out-migrants upon departure from the city, as well as from land grabbers who resell grabbed land. In our modeling, absentee landlords are price takers over a single period of time. They play the role of \"market makers\" allowing for a simplified representation of the land market. ${ }^{11}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ The prevalence of property rights in rural areas is very low in many countries. This is the case for instance when tenure in rural areas is overwhelmingly customary. Some countries may not have a land registration system or a cadastre for rural areas. Relaxing this assumption would not change the main outcomes of the model while adding unnecessary complexity.\n    ${ }^{9}$ Productivity in the rural area is low and does not depend on individual intrinsic characteristics.\n    ${ }^{10} R_{t}$ could also be interpreted as the time-varying difference between the urban and rural land prices. Under this alternative definition-which would assume an initial land endowment in the rural area for each individual$R_{t}$ would be much smaller than under the previous definition as it would only represent the fraction of income needed to complement the proceed of the rural land sale to purchase an urban plot. The two definitions for $R_{t}$ are mathematically equivalent in our setting under the assumption of a zero price for rural land.\n    ${ }^{11}$ The existence of absentee landlords is also a standard assumption in static urban economics model where they sell land to households competing for land (see Fujita 1989).",
      "13": "# 2.1 Decisions \n\nAt the beginning of each period $(t, t+1)$, an individual makes two choices: whether to migrate and whether to purchase a property right.\n\nLet us denote $\\mathbf{d}_{\\mathbf{t}}^{1}=\\left(d_{t}^{U, i}, d_{t}^{F, i}\\right)$ the vector of choice variables made by individual $i$, where $d_{t}^{U, i}$ is the migration decision and $d_{t}^{F, i}$ is the land tenure decision.\n$d_{t}^{U, i}$ takes the value 1 when the individual decides to migrate to (or remain in) the urban area between time $t$ and $t+1$, and the value 0 if the individual decides to migrate to (or remain in) the urban area between time $t$ and $t+1$.\n\nBecause property rights provide protection against land grabs, formality is preferable over informality. It is, however, costly to establish: an individual residing on an informal plot in the city at time $t$ needs to decide whether to pay a formalization fee $f_{t}$ to obtain a property right between time $t$ and $t+1$ or not to pay anything and continue to hold the plot informally. ${ }^{12}$ The fee is proportional to the value of the land:\n\n$$\nf_{t}=\\mu \\cdot R_{t}\n$$\n\nwith $0<\\mu<1$. It is a one-time payment (e.g. registration in a cadastre) and does not need to be paid again in subsequent periods as long as the individual uses the plot, i.e. as long as the individual remains in the city. $d_{t}^{F, i}$, the land tenure choice variable, takes the value 1 when the individual decides to establish a property right between time $t$ and $t+1$ and takes the value 0 otherwise.\n\n### 2.2 Shocks\n\nIndividuals move in and out of the urban area and in and out of residential formality throughout their infinite lifetime. Movements between locations and between land tenure situations are governed by migration and land tenure decisions (as individuals may seek property rights when residing in the city) in the face of productivity shocks and land grab shocks.\n\nLet us start with shocks and denote $\\epsilon_{t}^{i}=\\left(\\epsilon_{t}^{P}, \\epsilon_{t}^{Q, i}\\right)$ the vector of shocks faced by individual $i$ in period $(t, t+1)$.\n\nFirstly, $\\epsilon_{t}^{P}$ is a negative productivity shock (such as a weather shock) that affects the wage in the rural area in period $(t, t+1) . \\epsilon_{t}^{P}$ takes the value 1 when the shock occurs and 0 otherwise.

The shocks $\\epsilon_{t}^{G, i}$ for $i=1, . ., I$ are assumed to be i.i.d. and occur with exogenous probability $\\pi^{G} . \\pi^{G}$ reflects tenure insecurity on informal plots. It may reflect the probability that an agent of the land administration or a judge will be willing to facilitate an eviction. It also inversely reflects the degree of protection that informal dwellers may have under current legislation and practices (e.g. if evictions are banned by local authorities and if this ban is implemented, then $\\pi^{G}=0$ ). Only plots faced with a land grab opportunity $\\left(\\epsilon_{t}^{G, i}=1\\right)$ and which are not held formaly $\\left(x_{t}^{F, i}=0\\right)$ will be grabbed or evicted.

Decisions $\\left(d_{t}^{U, i}\\right.$ and $\\left.d_{t}^{F, i}\\right)$ and shocks $\\left(\\epsilon_{t}^{P}\\right.$ and $\\left.\\epsilon_{t}^{G, i}\\right)$ occur within time periods generically denoted $[t, t+1) .{ }^{13}$ We specify here the exact timing of events within a period $[t, t+1)$. We assume the following sequence: at time $t$, individuals are located either in the city or the rural area and may or may not have a property right. Shortly after time $t$, individuals simultaneously decide where they want to locate (possibly relocate) and whether they want to purchase a property right (if they have not done so earlier for the plot they occupy). Immediately after this decision is made, they may then migrate (possibly involving the sale or purchase of land from absentee landlords) and pay for the property right for those settling in the city and wishing to formalize. In the first half period $(t, t+0.5)$, the city faces land grab opportunity shocks (idiosyncratic probabilities of land grab opportunities are drawn). At time $t+0.5$, land plots exposed to grabbing are grabbed if unprotected (see below). . Land grab activities can affect urban wages for the second half of the period (through a change in the city composition as individuals that lose their plot are forced to move to the rural area shortly after time $t+0.5$ ). ${ }^{14}$ The rural productivity shock occurs at $t+0.5$ and affects location decisions in the next period.

These are households who choose to live in the city at the beginning of the period $\\left(d_{t}^{F, i}=1\\right)$, who did not hold a formal property right at the beginning of the period $\\left(x_{t}^{F, i}=0\\right)$, and who did not become formal during the period $\\left(d_{t}^{F, i}=0\\right)$.

The land grab opportunity shocks are drawn at a time in $(t, t+0.5)$, defining a subset $\\mathcal{I}_{t}^{R} \\subseteq \\mathcal{I}_{t}$ of informal residents at risk of being grabbed, with $\\mathcal{I}_{t}^{R}=\\left\\{i \\mid \\varepsilon_{t}^{G, i} \\cdot d_{t}^{F, i} \\cdot\\left(1-x_{t+1}^{F, i}\\right)=1\\right\\}$. At time $t+0.5$, if a plot $i \\in \\mathcal{I}_{t}^{R}$, is grabbed, grabbers can immediately sell off the plot on the land market (to absentee landlords) at the prevailing market land price $R_{t}$.

Benefits are captured through agglomeration effects, where the productivity (and thus the wage) of each individual in the city depends on the size and composition of the urban labor force (see Duranton, 2013) as well as on land tenure. The latter assumption reflects the fact that informal plot owners have a reduced labor supply as shown for example by Field (2007) in the case of Lima, Peru. Assuming that each individual is characterized by an exogenous ability $a_{i}>0$ and contributes $a_{i}$ units of labor to production when residing formally in the city and $(1-\\kappa) \\cdot a_{i}$ with $0<\\kappa<1$ when residing informally in the city, we can further define the total efficient labor in the city as\n\n$$\nL_{s}= \\begin{cases}L_{t, 1}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_{i} \\cdot\\left(1-\\kappa \\cdot\\left(1-x_{t+1}^{F, i}\\right)\\right) \\cdot d_{t}^{U, i} & \\text { for } s \\in(t, t+0.5] \\\\ L_{t, 2}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_{i} \\cdot\\left(1-\\kappa \\cdot\\left(1-x_{t+1}^{F, i}\\right)\\right) \\cdot x_{t+1}^{U, i} & \\text { for } s \\in(t+0.5, t+1]\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIf residing in the urban area, the wage of individual $i$ can then be specified as\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{17}$ The set of non-grabbed dwellers is $\\mathcal{J}_{t}=\\mathcal{H}_{t} \\backslash \\mathcal{J}_{t}^{G}$.

We assume that each individual consumes one unit of land and that there is a unique price for land in the city at any given point in time. ${ }^{22}$ We assume that the ratio of the land price to the average income is constant. This long-term relation has been established at the city level both theoretically and empirically in the literature (see Ried and Uhlig, 2009, Malpezzi, 1999, and Leung, 2014). Since transactions only occur during the first half of the period (households purchase or sell land at the beginning of the period, and grabbers sell off grabbed land at time $t+0.5$ ), the price is a function of the population and wage that prevail during $(t, t+0.5]$, so we have\n\n$$\nR_{t}=\\lambda \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} W_{t, 1}^{U, i} \\cdot d_{t}^{U, i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{t}^{U, i}}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{19}$ The formula can be derived by assuming a production function\n\n    $$\n    Y=\\frac{\\sigma \\cdot[1+L]^{1 / \\gamma+1}}{1 / \\gamma+1}\n    $$\n\n    with $w_{t}^{i}=a_{i} \\frac{d V}{d V}$.\n    ${ }^{20}$ Congestion here reflects the various externalities associated with city size, including travel distance and time (Izraeli and McCarthy, 1985), pollution (Lamsal et al., 2013) or criminality (Glaeser and Sacerdote, 1999).\n    ${ }^{21}$ The formula can be derived as the average transport cost in a mono-centric city with convex transport costs (see Fujita, 1989).\n    ${ }^{22}$ This can be viewed as the average price of land in the city.

Transition formula (14) recognizes that to have a property right at time $t+1$, the individual must have decided to remain in or to move to the city between time $t$ and $t+1$ and either already had a property right at time $t$ or acquired one between time $t$ and $t+1$.\n\n# 3 Stochastic game and social planner solution \n\nWe will now determine how the system evolves under two different optimization problems and associated solution concepts (stochastic game and social planner optimum). This involves determining how states at the beginning of one period are followed by policy functions during the period (decisions in our framework) that determine states at the beginning of the following period. To do this, let us define the strategy for individual $i$ as the function from the vector of states $\\mathbf{x}_{t}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}\\left(x_{t}^{U, i}, x_{t}^{F, i}\\right)_{i=1, \\ldots, N} \\\\ \\text { ( }\\end{array}\\right\\}$ into individual decisions $\\mathbf{d}_{t}^{\\prime}=\\left(d_{t}^{U, i}, d_{t}^{F, i}\\right)$, which we simply denote $D_{t}^{i}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{t}\\right) .{ }^{26}$\n\nTo understand how strategies are determined, we now need to understand how individuals are affected by decisions. To do that, observe that at time $t$, when individual $i$ decides to live in the rural area during the period $(t, t+1]$ (i.e. $d_{t}^{U, i}=0$ ), he will receive $\\left(W_{t, 1}^{R}+W_{t, 2}^{R}\\right) / 2+S_{t}^{i}$ in the period. When individual $i$ decides to live in the urban area during the period, he will pay $d_{t}^{F, i} \\cdot f_{t}+P_{t}^{i}$ at the beginning of the period, receive wage $W_{t, 1}^{U, i} / 2$ and incur the congestion cost $C_{t, 1} / 2$ during the first half period. During the second half period, if the individual is forced to leave the city because he faced a land grab opportunity at $t+0.5$ (i.e. $\\epsilon_{t}^{G, i}=1$ ) and did not have a property right (i.e., $x_{t+1}^{F, i}=0$ ), then he will receive $W_{t, 2}^{R} / 2$; otherwise, he will receive a wage $W_{t, 2}^{U, i} / 2$, incur a congestion cost $C_{t, 2} / 2$, and receive his fraction of the land grab proceeds $\\mathcal{G}_{t}^{i}$. The net income of the individual who decides to reside in the city in $(t, t+1)$ is thus\n\n$$\ny_{t}= \\begin{cases}\\frac{1}{2}\\left(W_{t, 1}^{U, i}-C_{t, 1}+W_{t, 2}^{R}\\right)-P_{t}^{i} & \\text { if } \\epsilon_{t}^{G, i}=1, x_{t+1}^{F, i}=0 \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(W_{t, 1}^{U, i}-C_{t, 1}+W_{t, 2}^{U, i}-C_{t, 2}\\right)+\\mathcal{G}_{t}^{i}-d_{t}^{F, i} \\cdot f_{t}-P_{t}^{i} & \\text { otherwise. }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThus, we have the utility of individual $i$ over the period $(t, t+1]$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{26}$ Note that because decisions are made before shocks occur in each period, they are only functions of the current states but not of the realization of the shocks.",

We then let the initial guess of $\\mathbf{V}^{a l l}(\\mathbf{x})$ be $\\mathbf{V}_{0}^{a l l}(\\mathbf{x})=\\mathbb{E}\\left\\{u^{i}\\left(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{D}_{0}(\\mathbf{x})\\right)\\right\\} /(1-\\beta)$. Denoting $\\left(\\mathbf{D}_{t}^{-i}(\\mathbf{x}), \\mathbf{d}^{i}\\right)=$ $\\left(D_{t}^{1}(\\mathbf{x}), \\ldots, D_{t}^{i-1}(\\mathbf{x}), \\mathbf{d}^{i}, D_{t}^{i+1}(\\mathbf{x}), \\ldots, D_{t}^{N}(\\mathbf{x})\\right)$, we compute\n\n$$\nV_{t}^{i}(\\mathbf{x})=\\max _{\\mathbf{d}^{i}} \\mathbb{E}\\left\\{u^{i}\\left(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{D}_{t-1}^{-i}(\\mathbf{x}), \\mathbf{d}^{i}\\right)+\\beta \\cdot V_{t-1}^{i}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{+}\\right)\\right\\}\n$$\n\nfor each $i=1, \\ldots, N$, and let $D_{t}^{i}(\\mathbf{x})$ be the optimizer for individual $i$ at the $t$-th iteration for $t \\geq 1$. At iteration $t$, we know the value function and policy functions at the previous iteration $t-1$ for every individual. Each individual determines his own optimal decision under the assumption that the other individuals make their decisions at $t$ that replicate their policy functions at $t-1$. Note that although the $\\mathcal{F}$ operator has to be solved jointly for all individuals, equation (20) can be solved separately for each individual $i$. This makes equation (20) much easier and faster to solve. We iterate over $t$ until both $\\mathbf{V}_{t}^{a l l}$ and $\\mathbf{D}_{t}(\\mathbf{x})$ converges. The converged value and policy functions are the solution to the stochastic game.\n\nFrom Maskin and Tirole (2001), we know that there exists a Markov-perfect equilibrium for our stochastic games with finite action spaces. However, our stochastic games may still have multiple equilibria, although Maskin and Tirole (2001) point out that the Markov-perfect equilibrium concept, a refinement of the Nash equilibrium, can be applied to eliminate or reduce the multiplicity of equilibria in dynamic games. Recently, Borkovsky et al. (2010) applied the homotopy approach to detect equilibrium multiplicity for games with continuous strategies, and Judd et al. (2012) developed all-solution homotopy methods to find all equilibria of static and dynamic games with continuous strategies. Yeltekin et al. (2015) provide a numerical method for computing all subgame-perfect equilibria of dynamic games with both discrete and continuous strategies, but their examples consist of only two or three-player dynamic games even with massive parallelization. As our examples are stochastic games and have a large number of players (in our example $N=5$ players and $2 N=10$ dimensions of states), it is still challenging to find all equilibria for such a large-dimensional problem, so we leave this for future research.",
      "23": "# 4 Model calibration \n\nWe choose values for the model parameters based on econometric estimates in the economic literature on urbanization and development. When econometric estimates are not available, we calibrate the remaining model parameters to match observed patterns of urbanization in developing countries. For most significant model parameters, we conduct a sensitivity analysis over the range of their plausible values. Table 1 lists the model's parameters and shows the chosen values.\n\nWe set the number of economic agents to 5 in order to balance the model's computational feasibility with tractability. We interpret the number of agents as population quantiles. We consider a uniform distribution of abilities over $(0,1]$ with $a_{i}=i / N$ for $i=1, \\ldots N$. Agent $N$ is thus the individual of highest ability $a_{N}=1$. We normalize the before-productivity-shock rural wage $w^{R}$ to 1 . We set the informal residency penalty on productivity $\\kappa$ equal to .2 , consistently with Field (2007). We choose a value of 3 for $\\sigma$. In developed economies for which state-of-the-art studies control for sorting according to ability, an increase in city size of 10 percent causes productivity to increase by between .3 and .8 percent (Duranton, 2009). We thus choose a benchmark value of $\\gamma$ of 11 , which yields productivity increases of .4 to .7 percent depending on city size. ${ }^{29}$ We choose a value of .2 for the rural wage elasticity to adverse shocks, $\\eta$, based on Jayachandran (2006) who estimated an rural wage elasticity of 17 percent to a weather shock. Wet set the probability of adverse income shock in rural area, $\\pi^{P}$, to .3 based on Damberg and AghaKouchak (2013), who report 12 episodes between 1979 and 2013 where more than 20 percent of the land in the Southern Hemisphere was under moderate to severe drought. This corresponds to a drought every three years or a yearly probability of a drought of approximately $1 / 3 .{ }^{30}$\n\nAs regards the congestion cost parameters, we choose a value of 1 for $b$ and .3 for $\\delta$. These numbers are based on the average of Kahn (2010) estimates, who reports city-size elasticities of $.14, .25$ and .49 for commute times, carbon monoxide pollution and for violent crime respectively. Our choice of $\\lambda$ is based on Malpezzi (1999), who reports a median housing price-to-income ratio in 133 US MSAs of 4.5. Assuming that land represent two-thirds of total housing costs and considering that our period is 10 years, this leaves us with a value of .3 .\n\nFor the formalization cost parameter, $\\mu$, we choose a value of .3 . There is a wide variety of situations in terms of formalization contexts, with costs ranging from a few percentages of land value to up to 100 percent or more of the value of the land (see Durand-Lasserve et al., 2015). For $\\pi^{G}$ we assume a value of .1 which is consistent with the high prevalence of conflicts in the cities of developing countries.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{29}$ In our model, wage elasticity with respect to urban labor force size is $\\frac{L}{\\gamma(1+\\varepsilon)}$. Since $L$ is comprised between 1 and 5 , a value of $\\gamma$ comprised between 10.4 and 16.6 ensures that wage elasticities are comprised between 0.03 and 0.08 in any state of the economy.\n    ${ }^{30} .3$ is a conservative estimate as other shocks affecting incomes such as conflicts, natural disasters or health crises can also occur (see Zceleczky and Yosef, 2014).",

We use an annual discount rate of .985 , which is consistent with the number adopted by long run dynamic computational forward-looking economic models, e.g., Nordhaus' DICE model (Nordhaus, 2008). Given that a period spans over 10 years in our model, this translates to $(.985)^{10}=.86$.\n\nGiven a significant range of heterogeneity for some model parameters, we conduct a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the model's robustness to chosen parameter values. Specifically, we analyze our results' sensitivity to variations in following model parameters: (a) income effect of agglomeration, $\\gamma$, of 5 (high agglomeration potential) and 100 (low agglomeration potential); (b) cost of land tenure formalization, $\\mu$, of .9 (high formalization cost); and (c) probability of land \"grab\", $\\pi^{G}$ of .05 (low chance of eviction) and .5 (high chance of eviction).\n\n# 5 Simulation Results \n\nWe solve equations (17) and (19) as explained in section 3 for a set of parameter values described in section 4 to obtain the value functions that can be used to infer stationary states and corresponding optimal decision rules. We then simulate dynamic urbanization paths corresponding to the social optimum and the Markov perfect equilibrium based on the realization of randomly drawn shocks $\\epsilon_{t}^{P}$ and $\\epsilon_{t}^{G, i}$.\n\nFigure 4 illustrates one of such simulated paths that corresponds to solving for a Markov-perfect equilibrium under a low formalization cost, low agglomeration potential and low risk of eviction.

Next period, this agent faces an increase in wage income and purchases a title for his plot. In period 4 , another, less productive, agent moves into the city, and chooses to stay informal. The wage incomes of both agents 4 and 5 increase thanks to the agglomeration effect and agent 4 chooses to formalize. The stationary state is obtained in period 5 as agents 1,2 , and 3 do not find it optimal to move into the city as the agglomeration potential is low. In this stationary state the urbanization rate is 40 percent and the rate of informality is 0 percent (all urban residents eventually choose to formalize their land plots). We can also see that welfare (defined as the sum of agent's discounted utilities $\\sum V^{i}$ in the stationary state and normalized to 100 in period 1 for illustration purposes) increases as agents move in the city and become formal. This result is consistent with earlier theoretical and empirical evidence of the welfare improving aspects of urbanization (Bertinelli and Black 2004) and secure property rights (Feder and Feeny 1991).\n\nWhile Figure 4 is illustrative of the urbanization dynamics in our model, it is not generalizable as each simulation path results in a different stationary state given initial states and the history of productivity and land grab shocks. To obtain generalizable results, we simulate dynamic urbanization and formalization paths 100,000 times for each initial state and parameter values, resident in the initial state. The results were very similar.",

Figure 6 shows the same simulation results when the land formalization cost is high $(\\mu=0.9)$.\n\nBeginning with Figure 5 (panel a), we see that when agglomeration potential is high and eviction probabilities are low to moderate, the Markov-perfect stationary equilibria is consistent with an expected urbanization rate of 60 percent. When the agglomeration potential is low or moderate and eviction probabilities are high, the expected urbanization rate declines to 40 percent. Figure 6 (panel a), shows a similar pattern. These results lead to the following proposition:\n\nProposition 1a: The urbanization rate in the Markov-perfect stationary equilibrium increases when (a) eviction enforcement is weak, and (b) agglomeration potential is high.\n\nThe underlying intuition behind Proposition 1a is as follows. The urbanization dynamics in our model are driven by the realized benefits of moving to the city. Agents with lower abilities can only find it individually optimal to move to the city when agglomeration potential is high enough to compensate for the urban rent and congestion costs. Even in these situations the decision to move to the city is not warranted. As their income is not sufficient to pay for formalization costs, agents choose to stay informal for some time before they can afford paying for land titles. When the probability of land eviction is high, low productive and risk-averse agents will find it suboptimal to move to the city.\n\nNow, let us turn to Figure 5 (panel b), which represents simulated results for the social optimum, and let us compare these results to those from panel (a). We see that irrespective of variations in model parameters, the expected urbanization rate is 60 percent. The expected urbanization rates are the same for the social optimum and the Markov-perfect stationary equilibrium when agglomeration potential is high and eviction probabilities are low to moderate. The expected urbanization rates are, however, higher for the social optimum that for the Markov-perfect stationary equilibrium for low or moderate agglomeration potential and high eviction probabilities. A similar pattern is observed when we compare panels (a) and (b) of Figure 6, although the expected urbanization rate of 60 percent is not always sustained when land tenure formalization costs are higher. These results lead to the following proposition:\n\nProposition 1b: The urbanization rate under the Markov-perfect stationary equilibrium is lower than in the social optimum when (a) agglomeration potential is low, and (b) eviction enforcement is strong.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{32}$ The numerical values of expected urbanization and land formalization rates that correspond to the model simulations are shown in appendix Table A.1.",

      "29": "To understand the logic behind Proposition 1b, it is important to recall the important distinction between the allocation of urban residents under the social optimum and the Markov-perfect equilibrium. In the Markov-perfect equilibrium, all agents move sequentially and make their land formalization decisions simultaneously. In the social optimum all decisions are made by the joint welfare-maximizing social planner, who has discretion over the timing of individuals moving into the city. The social planner may then choose to move less productive agents into the city first and allow them to obtain land titles before they can be evicted by more productive agents entering the city. Proposition 1b makes an important claim that the path of urbanization itself matters for final urbanization outcomes - an issue completely overlooked in static models of urbanization.\n\nCombining propositions 1a and 1b yields the following corollary:\nCorollary 1: In cities that have low agglomeration potential and strong eviction enforcement, the urbanization rate is low and lower than the social optimum.\n\nThis finding resonates well with the observed over-enforcement of evictions in the developing countries. The model suggests that, in some contexts, local governments may have done more harm than good by checking migration to cities through eviction of informal settlements (see Lall et al., 2006, on the causes of over-restrictive internal migration policies and Durand-Lasserve and Selod, 2009, on eviction policies). Over-enforcement of evictions may have caused some cities to be undersized (i.e., overlooking the potential benefits of further agglomeration) in a way that is similar to the enforcement of migration restrictions (see Au and Henderson, 2006, on the case of Chinese cities).\n\nThe next important issue to investigate is that of land tenure formalization. We see from Figure 5 (panel a) that when land tenure formalization costs are low, all agents that choose to move to the city also choose to formalize. This does not always happen when formalization costs are high. Figure 6 shows that informal residency can be sustained in the Markov-perfect stationary equilibrium when the eviction probability is low. If the city exhibits medium to high agglomeration potential, the observed informality rate is two-thirds. When the city's agglomeration potential is low, all residents are informal. These observations constitute the basis for the next proposition:\n\nProposition 2a: Informality can be sustained in the long run in the Markov-perfect stationary equilibrium. Informality is all the more likely to prevail as formalization costs are higher, eviction enforcement is weak, and agglomeration potential is low. For low land formalization costs, informality is resorbed.\n\nThe underlying explanation for Proposition 2a is fairly straightforward. Agents' decisions to formalize are determined by the difference between the expected marginal benefits of avoided eviction and potential gains from evicting other informal residents, and the realized marginal cost of formalizing land tenure. As the probability of land eviction declines, the latter effect",
      "30": "tends to dominate and no one formalizes. When the city's agglomeration potential is low, the city is smaller (Proposition 1a), and the expected gain from evicting other informal residents diminishes. This, in turn, leads to an even higher share of informal residents in the city.\n\nFigure 5 (panel b) shows that even when formalization costs are low, informality is desirable in the social optimum when both the city's agglomeration potential and the probability of eviction are low. In this case, the resulting urbanization rate ( 59 percent) is higher compared to that observed in the Markov-perfect equilibrium ( 40 percent). We observe a similar phenomenon when the formalization cost is high. Figure 6 (panel b) shows that for low to medium values of the city's agglomeration potential and the eviction probability, informality is more prevalent under the social optimum, and the expected urbanization rate is higher ( 56 percent) compared to that observed in the Markov-perfect equilibrium ( 40 percent). This finding leads to the following proposition:\n\nProposition 2b: The social optimum does not necessarily require a fully formal city.\nTo understand this proposition it is important to point out that our model considers an utilitarian social optimum defined as the discounted sum of of expected utilities of all economic agents. Under this utilitarian social optimum, the social planner may choose to relocate an individual to the city even if it is individually optimal for that agent not to migrate into the city. In this case, the social planner's choice is driven by the positive agglomeration externalities this agent imposes on other city residents. If the expected utility gain from agglomeration externalities for other city residents exceeds the utility loss for that individual, the social planner will find it optimal to relocate the agent to the city. However, in view of the high formalization costs, the social planner may not find it optimal to require that individual to formalize, leading to greater informality.",

Table 2 shows the values of the simulated value functions of the five economic agents under Markov-perfect equilibria (columns 4-8), the sum of their value functions (column 9), and the value function corresponding to the social optimum (column 10). We see from Table 2 that the sum of agents' utilities is highest in cities with the highest agglomeration potential $(\\gamma=5)$ and the lowest formalization cost $(\\mu=0.3)$ irrespective of the values of the eviction probability. In this case the sum of agents' expected utilities is the same as the expected sum of utilities, which implies that the Markov-perfect equilibria are also the social optima. This result leads to the following proposition:\n\nProposition 3: Simulated Markov-perfect stationary equilibria Pareto dominate other equilibria and are socially optimal under (a) high agglomeration potential and (b) low formalization costs.\n\nProposition 3 implies that the equilibria observed in developed countries, where the agglomeration potential is high and formalization costs are low, are likely to be socially optimal. Urbanization can thus be left to the market when the parameters of the economy are favorable. The proposition also highlights that in the absence of effective policies to improve those parameters in developing countries (e.g., making formalization more affordable), urbanization will likely be inefficient.",
      "32": "Careful examination of Table 2 shows that other equilibria may not be ranked unanimously as economic agents rank them differently. The expected agents' utilities are non-monotonous functions of (a) agglomeration potential, (b) eviction enforcement and (c) formalization costs. More productive agents that choose to reside in the city may face a trade-off between maximizing their wages (which depend on the city's agglomeration potential and agent's abilities) and increasing their gains from potential land grabs of informal residents' land plots as these two effects may or may not go in the same direction.\n\nTo further elaborate on this point, consider a city with medium agglomeration potential $(\\gamma=11)$. We can see from Table 2 that, regardless of formalization costs, the social optimum is reached for low to medium probabilities of eviction. Strict eviction enforcement deters in-migration of less productive agents who cannot afford to pay for land tenure formalization before they can establish themselves in the city. However, by looking at individual payoffs under different land eviction regimes, we see that more productive agents (4 and 5) achieve higher levels of expected utility when the eviction probability is high. For these agents, the marginal costs exceed the marginal gains of having an additional agent migrate to the city. As these agents are likely to be economic and political elites that establish themselves earlier in the city, their preferred eviction regime may not necessarily reflect the socially optimal outcome. These observations combined yield the following proposition:\n\nProposition 4: Strict eviction policies can be welfare reducing. It can be in the interest of the society but not necessarily in the interest of city elites to accept some level of informality.\n\nIn line with Corollary 1, our model provides a theoretical insight into the political economy of over-eviction policies. Although evictions remain widespread in many developing countries, it is interesting to note that some countries have moved away from strictly enforced evictions and modified their legal frameworks to provide protection against eviction (Durand-Lasserve 2007). Proposition 4 suggests that more democratic contexts are favorable to such changes.\n\n# 6 Conclusion \n\nWe analyze the interplay between urbanization and evolution of land property rights, two features of economic development that interact in a very important way. Understanding this interaction is crucial for developing countries as dysfunctional urban land property rights systems continue to prevail in many parts of the developing world, and their implications for the path of urbanization in the long run are not well understood. The model we develop provides a novel analytical framework to study this issue. It is a dynamic stochastic model of a representative city that jointly determines urbanization and evolution of land property rights. Each period, heterogeneous households decide whether to live in the city or in a rural area, and whether to pay for land property rights that will protect them from future eviction attempts. Holders of informal plots are randomly exposed to land seizure by other city dwellers, and seized plots can be resold",
      "33": "on the land market. Population movements in and out of the city are thus affected both by land grabbing and productivity shocks. Agglomeration and congestion effects are endogenous to migration, affecting wages and land prices.\n\nOur main result is that land property rights institutions, which are very difficult to reform, have a significant effect on the dynamics of urbanization in the long run. Contrary to the developed world experience, leaving urbanization to the market may be suboptimal because of the constraints imposed by dysfunctional property rights systems in developing countries. We also demonstrate that, under certain conditions, informality can be socially optimal, as it makes it possible for low-income residents to contribute to the urban economy. In these situations, strict urban eviction policies can be welfare reducing.\n\nIt is important to note that our major insights are conditional on structural fundamentals of prevailing land property rights systems. While our approach is justified given the persistence of land property rights institutions and apparent difficulties in reforming them, our comparative dynamics provides further insights into the political economy of changing land property rights systems. In future research it would be interesting to understand how the parameters of land property rights systems themselves evolve endogenously with urbanization and possibly shed light on the \"institutional trap\" that seems to be plaguing much of the developing world.\n\n# References \n\n[1] Acemoglu, D., S.

      "1": "# Summary findings \n\nSince 1989, private capital flows to a select group of developing countries have increased sharply, but developments in 1994 have caused concern about the sustainability of those flows. Several highly indebted developing countries that are implementing reform are concerned that a generalized reversal - similar to episodes of capital flight in the early 1980s - might disrupt their economies and threaten economic reform.\n\nBecause the surge in private capital flows coincided with a period of low international interest rates and intensive policy reform in developing countries, debate has been active about whether the surge is driven mainly by domestic (pull) or external (push) factors. Under the pull hypothesis, successful domestic policies are the key to ensuring sustainable capital inflows; under the push hypothesis, an increase in international interest rates would cause a reversal of those flows (back to the industrial world).\n\nUsing a partial adjustment model in which both domestic and external variables are defined, Hernández\nand Rudolph explain why private capital flows to some developing countries but not to orhers (using panel data for 1986-93 for 22 countries).\n\nThey argue that a generalized reversal is unlikely in countries that maintain a fundamentally sound macroeconomic environment. In fact, their empirical results show that domestic factors such as domestic savings and investment ratios significantly affected the recent surge in capital inflows.\n\nFurther, they suggest that countries that have not received significant foreign capital - including countries in Sub-Saharan Africa - could begin to if they implemented structural reforms that allow them to export, save, and invest at higher rates. Reducing their foreign debt (which might call for a continuation of recent debt reduction operations) could also help attract foreign private investors.\n\nThis paper - a product of the International Finance Division, International Economics Department - is part of a larger effort in the department to analyze policy implications of private capital flows to developing countries.

      "4": "# Summary \n\nSince 1989, there has been a sharp increase in private capital flows to developing countries. The similarity between conditions in the early 1980s and those in 1994-an increase in interest rates in the industrial countries after several years in which developing countries received sizable capital inflows, ${ }^{1}$ and the recent Mexican crisis ${ }^{2}$-has reopened the question of the sustainability of these flows and the appropriate policy responses to an adverse external shock to avoid a reversal of flows. In other words, the recent Mexican experience highlights the risks of a generalized reversal of flows and reopens the question of sustainability at a time when several developing countries remain highly indebted and are still in the process of completing some necessary economic reforms. Within this context, a generalized reversal of flows could seriously disrupt the economies of these countries and threaten their economic reform process.\n\nThe sustainability problem concerns the forces that have driven these flows in recent years, their relative importance, and the possibility that they could move adversely in the future. This research addresses these issues, particularly that of identifying the driving forces behind the surge in private flows. Because the surge in private capital inflows since 1989 has coincided with a period of low international interest rates and domestic policy reform in the developing world, there is a debate about whether the surge is driven primarily by domestic (pull) or external (push) factors. Under the pull hypothesis successful domestic policies are the key to ensuring sustainable capital inflows in the future, while under the push hypothesis an increase in international interest rates would cause a reversal of these flows (back to the industrialized world).\n\nThis research attempts to advance our understanding of the causal factors behind the recent surge in private capital inflows by including both pull and push factors in a model of the determinants of private capital inflows. In particular, it uses a partial adjustment model in which both domestic and external explanatory variables are defined, to explain the private capital flows to developing countries. The model is estimated using panel data for 1986-93 for 22 developing countries, including countries that have benefited from the new wave of private capital flows and countries that have not received capital flows. In addition, we compare the means of several economic indicators for two groups of countries: those that have received significant capital inflows in recent years and those that have not.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    Since the start of 1994, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board has raised short-term interest rates six times, from 3 percent to 6 percent.\n    ${ }^{2}$ Recall that the debt crisis was triggered when Mexico declared a moratorium in its external debt in 1982.",
      "5": "Our results show evidence that domestic factors play a significant role in explaining private capital flows. Thus countries may expect to continue to receive capital flows as long as domestic policy reforms remain on the right track: that is, as long as they increase domestic savings, use the capital flows to improve their long-term prospects by increasing investment rates, and increase the growth rate of exports. In other words, economic fundamentals must be improved to attract foreign investors.\n\nIn addition, the paper also discusses developing countries' risk of facing a major crisis -like the debt crisis of 1982-83-in the 1990s because of external factors, particularly an increase in international interest rates. We conclude that such a crisis is not likely to occur in the short or medium term, suggesting that a generalized reversal of flows is not a major threat. Nevertheless, in some recipient countries problems could develop in the short or medium term because of domestic factors. In response, appropriate corrective policy actions must be taken to strengthen economic fundamentals.\n\nThe findings from this research also imply that countries that have not received large amounts of foreign capital may begin to receive private inflows if they implement structural reforms that will allow them to export, save, and invest at higher rates. Reducing their foreign debt (which may call for a continuation of the debt reduction operations of recent years) may also play a significant role in attracting foreign private investors. This paper also opens up a new direction for further research in regions like SubSahara Africa, which has not benefited so far from the recent surge in private flows.",
      "6": "# Sustainability of Private Capital Flows to Developing Countries: Is a Generalized Reversal Likely? \n\nIn recent years there has been a sharp increase in private capital flows to developing countries. In fact, the capital account surplus-including net errors and omissions-for developing countries as a whole increased from US $\\$ 25$ billion in 1988 to US $\\$ 163$ billion in 1993, implying an annual growth rate of 46 percent. During the same time period, the current account deficit for developing countries as a group increased from about US $\\$ 20$ billion to US $\\$ 98$ billion, implying a growth rate of 37 percent a year (IMF 1994).\n\nYet the sharpest increase has occurred in private rather than in official capital inflows (table 1). Thus total long-term private flows-which include foreign direct investment, loans and bond issues, and equity portfolio investment-increased from US $\\$ 36$ billion in 1988 to about US $\\$ 159$ billion in 1993, a growth rate of 34 percent a year (World Bank 1994). At the same time, real official flows increased slightly-from US $\\$ 45$ billion in 1988 to US $\\$ 54$ billion in 1993 (about 4 percent a year).\n\nThe similarity between conditions in the early 1980s and those in 1994-an increase in interest rates in industrial countries after several years in which developing countries have received sizable capital inflows, ${ }^{1}$ and the recent Mexican crisis ${ }^{2}$-has reopened the question of the sustainability of these inflows and the appropriate policy responses to an adverse external shock to avoid a reversal of flows. In other words, the recent Mexican experience highlights the risks of a generalized reversal of flows and opens the question of sustainability in a magnified way.\n\nThe issue of sustainability is particularly relevant because several developing countries remain highly indebted and are still completing the economic reforms necessitated by the debt crisis, which erupted more than a decade ago.

      "7": "reduction in the current account deficit, could seriously disrupt the economies of recipient countries and could put at risk the continuation of economic reform.\n\nThe sustainability problem concerns forces that have driven these flows in recent years, their relative importance, and the possibility that they could move adversely in the future. This paper addresses these issues and, particularly, that of identifying the driving forces behind the surge in private flows.\n\nBecause the surge in private capital inflows has coincided with a period of low international interest rates and a period of domestic policy reform in the developing world, there has been a debate in the literature about whether the surge is driven primarily by domestic or by external factors. Calvo and others (1993) and Fernandez-Arias (1994) see the new wave of private capital inflows as being \"pushed\" by external factors-low rates of interest in the industrial countries and a slowdown in their economic growth—and therefore beyond the control of policymakers in developing countries. According to these analysts, an increase in international interest rates would cause flows to turn back to the industrial world. In contrast, Chuhan and others (1993) think that the surge in inflows has been driven mostly by domestic or \"pull\" factors, and view it as evidence that debt strategies have worked and domestic economic policies have been on the right track. According to this interpretation, successful domestic policies are the key to ensuring sustainable capital inflows in the future. But, these studies fall short of identifying relevant domestic variables and therefore do not provide straightforward economic policy recommendations. In sum, the push-pull story is still inconclusive.\n\nThis paper attempts to advance our understanding of the causal factors behind the recent surge in private capital inflows. It includes both pull and push factors in a model that analyzes the determinants of private capital inflows, and establishes some guidelines for appropriate government policies. The results show that domestic factors and, therefore, domestic economic policies, matter in explaining the new wave of capital inflows, implying that developing countries may continue receiving capital inflows as long as they use these resources to improve their long-term prospects.",
      "8": "The second section of the paper briefly describes the recent surge of private capital inflows and reviews the literature. This analysis establishes the appropriate framework for studying the sustainability problem, and to analyze the prospects of developing countries in the short or medium term. Our main conclusion holds that it is very unlikely that developing countries will suffer a significant adverse shock in the short term (including a reversal and \"hard-landing\") solely because of external factors (as was the case in the early 1980s). Nevertheless, as the recent Mexican experience illustrates, some problems could develop in the short or medium term because of domestic factors. In response appropriate corrective policy actions must be taken in the short term before capital inflows are reduced.\n\nThe third section sets up a partial adjustment model to explain private capital flows to developing countries. Both domestic and external explanatory variables are defined. The model is estimated for 198693 for 22 developing countries, including countries that have benefited from the new wave of private capital flows and countries that have not received capital flows. The model is estimated using a panel data technique because it is the most efficient way of simultaneously examining cross-country relationships at any point in time and country-specific trends over time.\n\n# Capital inflows in the 1990s: stylized facts and causes \n\nThere are three outstanding features of the current surge of capital inflows. First, although private capital flows to developing countries began to increase in 1986 after several years of decline, they accelerated when international interest rates began to fall (figure 1). In fact, several authors have argued that the increase in private capital inflows since 1989, particularly portfolio investment flows, is largely due to a fall in interest rates in international financial markets (see Calvo and others 1993 and FernandezArias 1994). The fall in interest rates induced investors in industrial countries to look elsewhere for higher returns, and it improved the creditworthiness of all developing countries-especially the highly indebted ones-by reducing the cost of servicing their debt.",
      "9": "Second, not all developing countries have benefited equally from this surge. The bulk of the capital inflows- 70 percent—has gone to East Asia and Latin America (table 2). Moreover, within these regions the distribution among countries has been uneven. In fact, the 15 countries receiving the largest flows received about 82 percent of all inflows during 1989-93 (figure 2), this suggesting that domestic factors may be important in explaining the new wave of private capital inflows. The regions and countries that have benefited the most are, generally, those that have implemented structural reforms in recent years. This connection provides some support for the pull theory (Chuhan and others 1993).\n\nThree episodes during 1994 in some of the countries that had received significant inflows in the past further illustrate the importance of domestic factors. In early 1994 the Turkish government was unable to place a US $\\$ 1$ billion bond issue because of the worsening of its fiscal deficit during 1993. Mexico experienced a capital outflow-of about US $\\$ 6.3$ billion-following the peasant uprising in Chiapas and the assassination of the ruling party's presidential candidate (the Mexican crisis of December 1994 further confirms the important of domestic factors). In Venezuela, poor supervision and monitoring of the banking system led to a banking crisis and induced a capital outflow of about US $\\$ 3$ billion.\n\nThird, the composition of flows in the 1990s is different from that in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when syndicated bank lending was the major channel through which developing countries borrowed from abroad. Today, foreign direct investment and portfolio equity investment play a major role, adding up to about 68 percent of total private flows (table 2). ${ }^{3}$ The large share of equity investment in the current surge is evidence of a larger risk-sharing component than in the late 1970s, possibly implying that the flows are more long term than in the past. The new composition of flows indicates that a structural change has occurred in international capital markets since the debt crisis, made up of two elements:\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    3 The share of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the 1970's was about 10 percent of total flows, while debt accounted for about 90 percent (both short-and long-term debt).",

Regulation changes include the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s Rule 144a and the new credit guidelines for the Samurai bond market introduced in August 1992.4\n\n\n# External factors: a review of the literature \n\nSeveral authors have attempted to quantify the importance of external and domestic factors in attracting capital inflows to developing countries. The pioneer work in this area, Calvo and others (1993), uses monthly data on the change in international reserves (a proxy for monthly capital inflows) as the dependent variable,-during 1988-91 for ten Latin American countries. The authors conclude that the drop in interest rates and the recession in industrial countries during those years accounted for about 50 percent of the variability in these flows, but the authors do not include any domestic variables to explain the inflows. Similarly, Fernandez-Arias (1994) uses quarterly data on portfolio capital flows (bonds plus equity) for thirteen countries during 1989-93 and concludes that about 86 percent of the increase in flows to these countries since 1989 is due to a fall in interest rates in international markets. Nevertheless, like Calvo and others (1993), Fernandez-Arias falls short of including and trying to identify relevant domestic variables and, therefore, does not provide straightforward economic policy recommendations. ${ }^{5}$\n\nRecently, there have been clear signs that international interest rates will recover from the record low observed during 1992-93-a clear threat to developing countries. ${ }^{6}$ Yet the increase in both real and\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    4 The introduction of Rule 144A in the U.S. stock exchanges has considerably simplified trading in foreign equities by eliminating costly settlements delays, registration difficulties, and dividend payment problems. Under Rule 144A, qualified institutional buyers in the United States no longer need to hold securities for a two-year period before they can be sold. Foreign insuers can now gain access to a relatively large number of U.S. institutional investors. Similarly, the credit rating standards for public placements of bonds in Japan were relaxed according to the new credit guidelines for the Samurai bond market.\n    5 This may also imply the existence of an specification error and biases in their results.\n    6 The six-month dollar denominated LIBO rate reached 3.9 and 3.4 percent in 1992 and 1993, respectively. IMF (1994: 127).",
      "11": "nominal interest rates is expected to be much lower than that witnessed in the years leading to the debt crisis. Then, the sharp increase in real interest rates in international markets resulted from a combination of tight monetary policies in some industrial countries to fight domestic inflation, and expansionary fiscal policies to boost their domestic economies. Between 1977 and 1981 the nominal LIBO rate rose from 6.5 to 16.7 percent (the average expost real LIBO rate in U.S. dollars, using the U.S. wholesale price index, rose from about 1.8 percent in 1978 to about 11.3 percent, 1982). By contrast, IMF estimates put the sixmonths dollar-denominated LIBO rate at 6.0 percent for 1995, and World Bank estimates put the rate at 5.8 percent for the next ten years. ${ }^{7}$\n\nTwo major reasons stand behind the assertion that the expected increase in international interest rates will be minor. First, current inflation rates in industrial countries are much lower than those in the late 1970s. In fact, the average inflation rate (using the consumer price index) for all industrial countries was 2.9 percent in 1993, and it is forecasted to be slightly lower in the next several years. By contrast, during 1979-81 that rate of inflation ranged from 9 to 12 percent. ${ }^{8}$ Second, the recent deficits run by the governments of the major industrial economies will force them to pursue a prudent fiscal policy in the future. In fact, these deficits are expected to be lowered by almost two percentage points of GDP during the next three years. ${ }^{9}$\n\nThus, although the increase in international interest rates represents a serious threat for developing countries, in real terms the increase will probably not be as great as the increase in the early 1980s and, therefore, will not be the major cause of a reversal of flows.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    7 IMF (1994: 17); World Bank, (1994, 7).\n    8 IMF (1994: 17); World Bank (1994: 7); IMF list in references (1986: 188).\n    9 The General Government Fiscal deficit of the major industrial countries increased from 1.7 percent of aggregate output in 1979 to about 4 percent in 1983-84; it then steadily decreased to a record low of 1.3 percent in 1989. It began increasing thereafter to reach 3.8 and 4.3 percent in 1992 and 1993, respectively. It is expected to fall to 3.9 and 3.5 percent of GDP in 1994 and 1995, respectively, and to be about 2.6 percent for the following three years. IMF (1986: 196, 1994: 57).",
      "12": "Another external factor standing behind the surge is the structural change in international financial markets and this is believed to be caused by permanent rather than transitory factors (that is, the change is due to technological and institutional developments that are most likely nonreversible). Also, the larger share of equity investment in the current surge of inflows suggests that foreign investors now have a longer investment horizon than in the late 1970s. As a result, there is little chance of seeing a reversal of flows in the short run because of a temporary negative development, which most likely would be the case with hot money. In sum, variables external to developing countries are unlikely to change substantially in the short or medium term, thus a generalized reversal of capital inflows would not be induced.\n\nIn addition to the two papers already discussed, Chuhan and others (1993) tries to measure the importance of domestic factors, as well as external factors, using monthly data on portfolio flows (bonds plus equity) from U.S. sources as the dependent variable. The sample includes 18 developing (recipient) countries in East Asia and Latin America during 1988-92. The authors conclude that domestic factors are at least as important as external factors in attracting flows to Latin American countries, and three to four times more important for East Asian countries. Yet their conclusions have limited policy implications because the explanatory variables used as proxies for domestic factors-for example, the stock priceearnings ratios and the secondary market price of a country's external debt—are not controlled by policymakers. Furthermore, as demonstrated in Fernandez-Arias (1994), the domestic explanatory variables used by Chuhan and others (1993) are not independent of international interest rates.\n\nAlthough external factors may explain a large part of the recent surge in capital inflows, the three papers mentioned above have limited implications because they fail to include in their samples countries that have not received substantial inflows in recent years, possibly inducing a sample-bias problem. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, the uneven distribution of private flows among regions and among developing countries within those regions—as well as the recent developments in Mexico, Turkey, and Venezuela—is suggestive of the role played by domestic factors in attracting flows to developing countries. Furthermore, the recipient countries began receiving the inflows in different periods, with some starting as early as 1988",
      "13": "or 1989 (Thailand and Malaysia, respectively), and others as recently as 1992 or 1993 (The Philippines and Peru, respectively). The importance of domestic factors can be assessed by comparing those countries that have received sizable capital inflows with those that have not attracted sizable inflows in the past.\n\n# The role of domestic factors: a preliminary assessment \n\nFor the purpose of this analysis developing countries are separated into two categories: high-capital-inflow recipient countries (HCIR) are those that in recent years have received private inflows averaging more than 2 percent of their 1992 GNP annually. Low-capital-inflow recipient countries (LCIR) are those that have received, on average, less than 2 percent of their 1992 GNP, annually. Capital inflows are averaged over a period starting when the surge began in each country (the cutoff period) and ending in 1993, or between 1990 and 1993 if there is no clear cutoff period (table 3).\n\nSeveral striking differences between the two groups can be seen (table 4). First, savings as a percentage of GNP for the HCIR countries is about twice as high as that for the LCIR countries. Furthermore, the countries that save the least within the HCIR group (Argentina and Mexico-17 percent) still save more than the average for the LCIR group. The higher savings rate in the HCIR group is mainly a result of a lower consumption rate of the private sector. The HCIR countries have consistently invested about eight percentage points more of GNP than the LCIR countries. It follows that national (foreign) savings have financed a larger (smaller) share of domestic investment in the HCIR countries than in the LCIR countries.\n\nSecond, the fiscal deficit in the LCIR countries is five times larger than that of the HCIR countries, meaning that both the private and the public sectors save more in the HCIR countries. Consequently, the average monthly inflation rate is about 1.2 percent higher in the LCIRs than in the HCIRs; that is, about 14 percent higher per year.",
      "14": "Third, the LCIR countries appear to be more unstable on several grounds. The coefficient of variability of the monthly inflation rate for the LCIRs is twice as large as that of the HCIR group. This difference is even greater when using the variance of the monthly inflation rate, which is computed after excluding the outliers in both groups (Argentina, Brazil, and Zaire). Likewise, the real exchange rate appears to be more volatile in the LCIR countries, probably adversely affecting their export industry. ${ }^{10}$ In addition, the political risk index (PRI) for the LCIR group is almost 11 points below that of the HCIR group. ${ }^{11}$ Moreover, for the LCIR countries this index is well below the prohibitive risk level of 40 .\n\nFinally, countries in the HCIR group appear to be more creditworthy in that they maintained lower indebtedness and a higher reserves ratio during the early years of the high capital inflows episode and have better-performing export industries. In fact, prior to the surge the stock of international reserves for the HCIR countries was, on average, twice as high as that for the LCIR countries, while indebtedness was about half as great. In addition, the export ratio in the HCIR countries is four percentage points higher than that in the LCIR countries- 10 percent points higher ( 32.8 percent compared with 23.2 percent) if the outliers in each group are excluded (Argentina among the HCIR group at 10.8 percent, and Jordan among the LCIR group at 86.8 percent). Furthermore, exports have also been growing at a higher rate in real terms in the HCIRs than in the LCIRs-the respective compound rates of growth are 8.5 percent and 4.8 percent annually-meaning that the repayment capacity of the HCIRs is improving faster than that of the LCIRs.\n\nThese facts provide a motivation for trying to assess more precisely the importance of pull factors. Although our empirical analysis in the next section looks similar to those carried out earlier by other authors, some important differences are worth noticing. First, we use a more comprehensive data set in that, instead of relying only on portfolio investment flows as the dependent variable, all sources of private\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ It is important to note that, because of missing data, the average group variance in the LCIR countries is computed with only six data points: Bolivia, Egypt, India, Jordan, Morocco, and Nigeria.\n    ${ }^{11}$ The PRI was developed by Business Environment Risk Intelligence (BERI). This index measures the sociopolitical conditions in a country using a $0-100$ scale. An increase in this index means lower political risk. A prohibitive risk (index below 40) means that political conditions severely restrict business operations: asset losses are possible and disturbances are part of daily life.",
      "15": "long-term funds are included (portfolio flows; foreign direct investment, which accounts for 50 percent of the inflows; and private loans). Second, a larger sample of 22 developing countries-all of those for which all relevant data are available-for the period 1986-93, is evaluated. As a result, we examine countries in the LCIR group as well as in the HCIR group. ${ }^{12}$ Third, as in Dooley and others (1994), we try to identify some domestic variables that may affect capital inflows and that, at the same time, can be more easily (at least indirectly) modified by policymakers in developing countries. ${ }^{13}$ Finally, because we use annual data, our results have a longer-term interpretation than those of previous studies. Our results also allow for a dynamic analysis of capital inflows, showing that the change in either domestic or external conditions will cause the inflows to adjust over time (as opposed to the static analysis adopted by the papers discussed above).\n\n# A stock adjustment model \n\nSuppose that a group of foreign agents is interested in investing in a particular developing country. It is assumed that there is a desired stock of foreign liabilities for each developing country $i$, which depends on internal as well as external conditions. This stock can be represented by:\n\n$$\nD^{*}{ }_{i t}=\\alpha_{i}+\\beta X_{i t}\n$$\n\nwhere $D^{*}$ is the desired stock of foreign liabilities and $X$ is the vector of exogenous variables. In any given period $t$, the desired value of the stock of foreign liabilities $\\left(D^{*}{ }_{i t}\\right)$ may not be completely realized because of information, physical, or procedural constraints. The adjustment process can be represented as:\n\n$$\nf_{i t} \\equiv D_{i t}-D_{i t-1}=\\delta\\left(D^{*}{ }_{i t}-D_{i t-1}\\right)+\\gamma f_{i t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i t}\n$$\n\nwith $0<\\delta, \\gamma<1$. This equation specifies that the change in the stock of foreign liabilities responds to the difference between the desired stock of $D$ and the lagged value of $D$, and the flow of the previous period, plus a random error term $\\varepsilon$. The partial adjustment mechanism implies that private capital inflows\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    12 The final sample was dictated by real exchange rate data availability.

      "16": "(which includes foreign direct investment) adjust the stock of foreign liabilities only partially toward its optimal level, $D^{*}$, which in turn varies along with changes in the underlying variables $X_{i t}$. The rationale for this first term is the standard one: it reflects the increasing costs of adjusting to the desired stock of foreign liabilities, when referring to new investment projects. The second term, $\\gamma f_{i t, D}$, reflects the presence of contractual obligations or changes in investment flows for decisions made earlier, which are modified during the second period given the prevailing state of nature. ${ }^{14}$\n\nSubstituting for $D^{*}{ }_{i t}$ in equation 2 and solving for the amount of flows $\\left(f_{i t}\\right)$ gives:\n\n$$\nf i t=\\delta \\alpha_{i}+\\delta \\beta X_{i t}-\\delta D_{i t-1}+\\gamma f_{i t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i t}\n$$\n\nEquation 3 can be rewritten as:\n\n$$\nf_{i t}=\\alpha^{\\prime}{ }_{i}+\\beta^{\\prime} X_{i t}-\\delta D_{i t-1}+\\gamma f_{i t-1}+\\varepsilon_{i t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\alpha^{\\prime}=\\delta \\alpha$ and $\\beta^{\\prime}=\\delta \\beta$.\nIt is important to note that the model as written in equation 4 has been designed to capture only longterm movements in the stock of foreign liabilities; hence, it does not allow for overshooting in fit.\n\n# External factors \n\nAmong the external variables that could affect capital inflows the international interest rate is a primary candidate. Two forces are at work: increases in the level of international interest rates make the opportunity cost of investing in developing countries higher, thus reducing the desired stock of foreign assets, and increases in international interest rates raise the total debt service obligation of the borrowing countries (for the portion of their external debt contracted at a variable rate), thus increasing their risk of default and reducing their creditworthiness. Therefore, the expected sign is negative.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    14 The justification for including two partial adjustment terms can be better understood by noticing that the decision to continue an investment project is different from the decision to start a new one. Moreover, FDI usually involves large investments that may take several years to implement and may imply long-term contractual (binding) obligations. A more restrictive version of the model would set $\\gamma$ equal to zero. For simplicity, only one period lag is assumed.",
      "17": "# Domestic factors \n\nBecause there are many potential domestic factors explaining the determination of the desired stock of foreign liabilities, the impact of these variables will be related through their effect on the investment climate.\n\n- Investment rate: Higher investment rates can improve the productive capacity of a country, which in turn can increase its repayment capacity as it achieves higher economic growth. Therefore, the expected sign is positive. However, investment can be financed by foreign savings, meaning that a positive correlation between investment rates and capital inflows may occur if foreign savings is the major source of investment financing. Two caveats are in order here. First, empirical evidence suggests that this problem may not be very important, as the bulk of investment in developing countries is financed by domestic savings. ${ }^{15}$ Second, the appropriate use of lags minimize this simultaneity or exogeneity problem.\n- Domestic savings rate: Complementarity among different types of savings, foreign and domestic, would reinforce the commitment to increases in the productive capacity and creditworthiness of a country. ${ }^{16}$ Private savings is intrinsically related to private consumption. Two alternative approaches should be tested. One implies that higher consumption levels are associated with individual perceptions of higher permanent income, which results in a higher desired stock of foreign liabilities today. Under this interpretation, individuals that want to smooth their consumption levels across time-if not liquidity constrained-would borrow to increase their current consumption levels, and this borrowing will lead to a positive relationship between consumption and capital flows. The second view implies more conservative foreign investors, who will be tempted to invest in those countries in which private savings are complementary to external savings.

This finding has been interpreted as evidence of capital immobility. If capital were mobile, there would be no reason to predict that countries with relatively high saving ratios over a given period would also have relatively high investment ratios, since savings would be redistributed to countries that offered relatively high rates of return on physical capital.",

This dummy variable may capture a structural change in the relationship between capital inflows and international interest resulting from the financial liberalization of the late 1980s, which led to a more integrated financial world. Column 2 shows that this parameter is negative, making the total effect of the interest rate during 1990-93 negative (the sum of $\\beta_{7}$ and $\\beta_{8}$ equals -0.00038 ). The results, however, capture only partially the previous literature findings since the parameter for the interest rate dummy, IDUM90, is not statistically significant at the 10 percent level (the t-test for the sum of $\\beta_{7}$ and $\\beta_{8}$ equals 0.29). ${ }^{21}$\n\n## Interest rate misspecification\n\nOther estimations, reported in columns 4 to 7 , confirm that the results reported in column 2 are robust to the use of other interest rate measures, such as the three-year U.S. Treasury bond rate (columns 4 to 6) and the first principal component of several U.S. interest rates and the U.S. industrial production\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    20 Table A.1. (second column) reports that interest rates are negatively correlated with total flows during 1986-93, but positively correlated during 1979-93.\n    ${ }^{21}$ Furthermore, a variance decomposition carried out using the results in column 2 shows that pull factors, as a block, explain about 32 percent of the variation in inflows in the short-run ( 66 percent taking a long-term approach), while push factors explain only 1 percent ( 2 percent using a long-term approach).",
      "22": "index (column 7, used in Calvo and others, and in Chuhan and others). ${ }^{22}$ This proves that our results differ from those reported elsewhere not because of the particular interest rate measure we are using. ${ }^{23}$\n\n# Different specification of capital flows \n\nForeign direct investment, which is not included in the inflows measure used in the studies by Fernandez-Arias, and Chuhan and others, and which represents the largest share of total private flows in our sample (see table 9 below), may be less sensitive to changes in interest rates than, say, portfolio flows (the dependent variable used by most of the other authors). ${ }^{24}$ When the dependent variable is total longterm capital flows excluding foreign direct investment, the total effect of the international interest rate on private capital flows during 1990-93, not statistically different from zero even though the estimated parameter for the interest rate dummy variable (IDUM90) becomes negative and significant (table 6 , columns 2, 3, 5 and 6). Thus, for example, the sum of $\\beta_{7}$ and $\\beta_{8}$ in regression 2 , table 6 , equals 0.00006 , while the $t$-test for this sum equals $0.05{ }^{25}$\n\nEven though these results do not completely corroborate the findings of Calvo and others, and Fernandez-Arias, they appear to be consistent with those of Niehans (1994) and Stockman (1988). These papers argue that there is not a straightforward relation between interest rate differentials and capital flows. ${ }^{26}$\n\nAdditional regressions are used to test for the robustness of our findings. A third regression excludes all (private) publicly guaranteed bank lending from the dependent variable, because this type of\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{22}$ As it is shown in Table A. 1 all the alternative measures for the level of U.S. interest rates are highly correlated. See also the discussion in Chuhan and others (1993) and in Fernandez-Arias (1994).\n    ${ }^{23}$ One possible reason for the low explanatory power of the international interest rate in all our regressions is that we are using a small number of time-series observations ( 8 years).\n    ${ }^{24}$ FDI also seems to show higher persistence over time than other types of flows, which probably explains the larger coefficient for the lagged dependent variable in tables 5 and 8 than in table 6.\n    ${ }^{25}$ A variance decomposition carried out using the results in column 2, table 6, shows that pull factors, as a block, explain about 56 percent of the variation in inflows both in the short run and in the long run, while push factors explain only 6 percent.\n    ${ }^{26}$ Niehans (1994) points out that \"If the underlying shift occurs in the domestic demand or supply of domestic assets, capital seems to flow toward higher interest rates, but if the shift occurs in the domestic demand or supply of foreign assets, capital seems to flow in the direction of lower yields.\"",
      "23": "flow may consist of nonvoluntary lending, especially during 1986-89 (table 7). The results are not significantly different from the regressions reported in table 5 . It is interesting to note that the parameter of export growth becomes higher and highly significant. Coefficients associated with interest rates continue to be small and insignificant, although they have the correct sign. ${ }^{27}$\n\nAlthough it is the purpose of this paper to explain the most recent episode of capital inflows, when a longer sample period-1979-93-is used (table 8), the estimated coefficient for the lagged endogenous variable is greater than the one reported for the shorter period (column 2, table 5). ${ }^{28}$ Even though the coefficients are smaller in general, the results concerning the investment ratio, the international interest rate, and the indebtedness ratio (net of reserves) appear to be consistent with previously reported regressions. ${ }^{29}$ However, coefficients associated with the volatility of the real exchange rate and to domestic (private) consumption turned out to be insignificant over the entire sample period.\n\nThis less than fully satisfactory result may be explained by noting that during the years preceding the debt crisis, most of the borrowing in developing countries was done by the public sector, implying that lenders were probably less concerned about savings of the private sector. Also, several developing countries have only recently began to liberalize their trade regimes, meaning that during the late 1970s and early 1980s their exports were highly concentrated in only one or two basic commodities (such as oil or copper), with low export elasticities with respect to the real exchange rate. The dummy variable for the Brady deals turns out to be significant, while the export growth parameter becomes negative, though insignificant.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{27}$ Regression 7 in table 7 is the only one in which the coefficient for the interest rate dummy variable, IDUM90, becomes negative and significant. Yet the sum of $\\beta_{7}$ and $\\beta_{8}$ is small ( -0.002 ) and not statistically different from zero (t-test equals -0.78 ). A variancedecomposition carried out using these results shows that pull factors, as a block, explain about 37 percent of the variation in inflows in the short run ( 51 percent in the long run), while push factors explain only 2 percent ( 3 percent in the long run).\n    ${ }^{28}$ It is worth noticing that under the within estimator, an increase in the number of years increases the consistency of the coefficient for the lagged dependent variable. In the small sample 1986-93, this autocorrelation coefficient is biased downward.\n    ${ }^{29}$ Again, regression 7 in table 8 is the only one in which the coefficient for the interest rate dummy variable, IDUM90, becomes negative and significant. Yet the sum of $\\beta_{7}$ and $\\beta_{8}$ is small ( -0.003 ) and not statistically different from zero (t-test equals -1.08 ). A variance decomposition carried out using these results shows that pull factors, as a block, explain about 22 percent of the variation in inflows in the short-run ( 46 percent in the long run), while push factors explain only 2 percent ( 4 percent in the long run).",
      "24": "# Long-term prospects \n\nAs argued above, external factors are not expected to worsen drastically in the short or medium term. Therefore, developing countries may continue to receive flows if they implement reforms that lead to an increase in domestic savings and investment, a reduction in the size of the central government deficit, and an increase in the growth rate of exports.\n\nThe econometric results discussed above, when applied to a simulation exercise, show that an increase in foreign reserves of, say, 5 percent of GNP (a fall in net indebtedness from 0.8 to 0.75 ), would allow a \"typical\" developing country to receive a larger flow of foreign private capital of about 0.3 percent of GNP in the medium term (figure 3 ). ${ }^{30}$ Similarly, a decrease in private consumption and an increase in gross domestic investment of, say, 5 percent of GNP each, would permit a \"typical\" developing country to receive about 1.6 percent of GNP more in terms of foreign capital over a period of four to five years (about 0.8 percent of GNP each; figures 4 and 5 ).\n\nOne final exercise consists of analyzing the effects of a debt-reduction operation. A Brady operation would allow a \"typical\" developing country to start receiving a larger (private) capital inflow of about 0.9 percent of GNP in the medium term (figure 6). As in the previous simulations, the inflow increases smoothly and stabilizes after about five years. A Brady deal differs from a simple increase in net reserves because it significantly increases the creditworthiness of the country. This result is instantaneously reflected in increases in the secondary market price of a country's debt. ${ }^{31}$\n\n## Could the Mexican crisis have been foreseen?\n\nBased on the above analysis a final word concerning the Mexican crisis should be made. The crisis triggered in Mexico last December after the devaluation of the peso has at least two components. On\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    30 Our empirical results are downward biased because of a small sample problem in panel data estimation (see Arellano and Bond 1988). Nevertheless, this bias implies that the effect on private capital inflows of any of the other exogenous variables is underestimated in absolute value.\n    31 For a detailed analysis of the Brady Operations see Fernandez-Arias (1993).",
      "25": "the one hand, the crisis is related to the tragic events occurring in 1994, such as the assassinations of two influential political leaders and the peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, which most likely had a negative impact on foreign investors' confidence. On the other hand, the crisis is also a consequence of poor macroeconomic management and a lack of strong fundamentals.\n\nUnfortunately, the effect of the former component is not measurable, at least not at this point in time given economists' current understanding and handling of sociopolitical events. The second component, however, is strongly supported by our previous analysis and by the fact that by end 1993 Mexico had poor fundamentals, at least compared with other countries within the HCIR group. By the end of 1993 all fundamentals were better for the average country within this group than for Mexico, except for the fiscal deficit and total external debt (both as a percentage GNP; table 10). It could be argued, then, that Mexico was more likely than other high-recipient countries to suffer a crisis if a negative shock occurred.\n\nFurthermore, our results also seem to be consistent with the different impact that the \"tequila effect\" had across regions and among countries within those regions. It is well known that Latin American countries were more affected by the Mexican crisis than East Asian countries, and that within the Latin America region Argentina was the country that suffered the most. These differences can be well explained by noting that: first, among the Latin American countries Argentina, like Mexico, also had poor fundamentals at the end of 1993-in fact these two countries had the worst fundamentals among all HCIRs (see Table A.2)—and second, in recent years the East Asian region has experienced an investment boom (with the exception of the Philippines) while the Latin American region has experienced a consumption boom (with the exception of Chile; figure 7). ${ }^{32}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    32 For this comparison across regions see also World Bank (1995: 16-17).",
      "26": "# Concluding remarks \n\nThis paper discusses the potential risks for developing countries of facing a major crisis-like the debt crisis of 1982-83-during the 1990s, especially after several years of receiving large amounts of foreign capital in the form of (mainly) foreign direct investment and portfolio flows (both equity and bonds). We conclude that a major crisis caused by external factors, mainly an increase in international interest rates, is very unlikely to occur in the short or medium term, suggesting that developing countries may act to reduce the possibility of a generalized reversal of flows, even after the Mexican crisis.\n\nEconometric results support the importance of pull factors as determinants of the recent wave of long-term private capital inflows to developing countries. Therefore, developing countries may continue to attract flows if they continue in the direction of recent years: improve the domestic investment climate by creating a less risky environment and improving their fundamentals.\n\nOur empirical results suggest that countries may increase the amount of foreign private capital they receive (as a share of GNP) if they invest more, reduce the current account deficit by increasing private domestic savings, reduce their indebtedness, increase their stock of foreign reserves, boost their export industry, and reduce the volatility of the real exchange rate.\n\nThese findings are important because they show that domestic factors-and therefore economic policy-matter, meaning that developing countries can avoid a reversal of flows. The findings also imply that countries that have not received large amounts of foreign capital may begin to do so if they implement the structural reforms that will allow them to export, save, and invest at higher rates. Reducing their foreign debt (which may call for a continuation of the debt reduction operations of recent years) may also play an important role in attracting foreign private investors. This study also opens up a new direction for further research in regions like Sub-Sahara Africa, which has not benefited from the recent surge in private flows.",

As argued earlier, our study is more comprehensive than previous research because it includes FDI (which is almost fifty percent of total private inflows) as part of long-term private capital flows. All data on financial flows, stocks and reserves are World Bank's from the Debtor Reporting System. ${ }^{1}$ Data on national accounts were obtained from The World Bank Database (ANDREX).\n\nData on international interest rates and the US industrial production index were obtained from the IMF's International Financial Statistics and from the Federal Reserve Board's publications. Interest rates used are: three-months U.S. Treasury bill rate (IFS line 60c), certificate of deposit rate (IFS line 60lc); 10year U.S. government bond yield (IFS line 61); three-month LIBOR (IFS line 60ldd); and three-year government bond yield (IFS line 61a). The U.S. production index was also taken from IFS (line 66). The 12-months U.S. Treasury bill rate was obtained from the U.S. Federal Reserve Board. Data on real effective exchange rates were obtained from the IMF.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    1 These data corresponds to those published in World Bank (1994).",

      "1": "# Abstract \n\nThis paper studies the long-term and intergenerational effects of the 1970s Indonesian school construction program, which was one of the largest ever conducted. Exploiting variation across birth cohorts and districts in the number of schools built suggests that education benefits for men and women persist 43 years after the program. Exposed men are more likely to be formal workers, work outside agriculture, and migrate. Men and women who were exposed to the program have better marriage market\noutcomes with spouses that are more educated, and households with exposed women have improved living standards and pay more government taxes. Mother's program exposure, rather than father's, leads to education benefits that are transmitted to the next generation, with the largest effects in upper secondary and tertiary education. Cost-benefit analyses show that school construction leads to higher government tax revenues and improved living standards that offset construction costs within 30-50 years.\n\nThis paper is a product of the Gender Global Theme.

      "3": "# 1. Introduction \n\nSchooling in developing countries has increased dramatically over the past few decades, and those governments spend approximately one trillion dollars annually on education (Glewwe and Muralidharan, 2016; World Bank, 2018). Despite this progress, 260 million children were still out of school in 2018. The question of which adult outcomes are affected by increases in access to education and whether these effects persist into the next generation is of broad research interest and great policy importance (see Currie and Moretti, 2003; Almond, Currie, and Herrmann, 2012; and Bhalotra and Rawlings, 2013 for evidence on the intergenerational transmission of human capital). Much research focused on women's empowerment finds that resources under the mother's control have a stronger positive impact on a child's health and schooling than those controlled by the father. ${ }^{1}$ In recent years, researchers have made significant advancements using randomized experiments, but in addition to potential challenges of external validity, the vast majority of interventions are evaluated soon after the intervention ends and there is limited research measuring effects more than 40 years after programs start. ${ }^{2}$ The question remains whether effects persist over time and continue into the next generation, or whether they fade out as some recent studies have indicated. ${ }^{3}$\n\nIn this paper, we test this directly by studying the long-term and intergenerational impacts of one of the largest primary school construction programs ever completed. Between 1973 and 1979, the Indonesian government constructed over 61,000 primary schools, averaging two schools per 1,000 primary school age children. We use 2016 nationally representative Indonesian data to examine the effects on a wide range of outcomes, including education, employment, migration, marriage, living standards, and taxes. Following the seminal work by Duflo (2001) who studies the effects of this school construction program on men's education and earnings in 1995, we employ a difference-in-differences strategy, exploiting variation across districts in the number of schools built and across birth cohorts in their exposure to the schools.\n\nIn addition to studying the long-term effects of this program on an extensive range of outcomes, many of which have not been studied before or have only been studied in isolation, one of the main contributions of this paper is the focus on the program's intergenerational impacts. A large literature on the intergenerational transmission of human capital has mainly focused on developed countries and has documented considerable persistence in economic opportunities as a source of increased economic inequality. ${ }^{4}$ Evidence on intergenerational\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Duflo (2012) provides a systematic review of this literature and finds the evidence base supporting this claim is not as strong as we generally believe. She states, \"the usual depiction of women as always making the best decisions for long-term development is somewhat exaggerated.\"\n    ${ }^{2}$ Reviewing 111 primary school interventions in developing countries, McEwan (2015) finds that only 10 percent had any evaluation take place more than one month after the intervention had ended. Notable exceptions include Baird, Hamory Hicks, Kremer, and Miguel (2016) who show positive labor market impacts 10 years after a deworming intervention in Kenya, and Gertler et al. (2014) showing higher earnings 20 years after an early child stimulation program in Jamaica. Duflo (2001), discussed in more detail below, evaluates this same Indonesian school construction program and finds positive labor market impacts 22 years after the program. Evidence from the U.S. indicates preschool and kindergarten programs lead to improved adult outcomes (Garces, Thomas, and Currie, 2002; Heckman et al., 2010; Chetty et al., 2011) as do health interventions (Bhalotra and Venkataramani, 2018). ${ }^{3}$ Evans and Ngatia (forthcoming) find that positive outcomes from a free school uniform program are gone eight years after the intervention. Blattman, Fiala, and Martinez (2020) find that grants to Ugandan youth show significant positive effects on earnings after four years but no effect by nine years. Andrabi et al. (2011) using data from Pakistan find that only one-fifth to one-half of student learning persists between grades. Jacob, Lefgren, and Sims (2010) find low persistence of teacher learning in the U.S. with three-quarters or more fading out within one year. ${ }^{4}$ Black and Devereux (2011) review the large literature on the intergenerational transmission of human capital that measures the persistence between parents' and children's educational attainment, while Currie (2011) and Almond",
      "4": "human capital spillovers from developing countries is sparse and we know even less on whether government interventions, such as school construction, can improve educational opportunities for disadvantaged children and improve intergenerational mobility. ${ }^{5}$ We are also able to extend the focus on working-age men in Duflo (2001) to study the impact of school construction on women and observe gender differences for both first and second-generation outcomes. This extension allows us to explore marriage market outcomes that appear to play a crucial role in the intergenerational transmission of human capital. Finally, school construction programs have large up-front costs and then benefits that are dispersed over time, so we perform a detailed costbenefit analysis to assess the welfare implications. In addition to calculating benefits based on improvements in living standards, we use tax data to study whether school construction pays for itself in terms of higher future government tax revenues.\n\nFigure 1 provides an overview of our findings. Due to the data's richness and the large number of outcomes, we want to be careful not to overemphasize any single significant result and so we take two approaches. First, following Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007), we create an index for each family of outcomes where we aggregate all individual outcomes in that family together. As described further in Section 3, we then estimate standardized effects from exposure to school construction on these outcome indexes (Banerjee et al., 2015). Second, since we examine multiple outcomes, we correct for the potential issue of simultaneous inference using multiple hypothesis testing. We calculate q-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg step-up method to control for the false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).\n\nThe consistent pattern seen in Figure 1 is that exposure to school construction improves long-term and intergenerational outcomes, especially if women, rather than men were exposed. ${ }^{6}$ School construction, not surprisingly, leads to improved educational outcomes. Duflo (2001) previously showed this for men, and we confirm it also improves women's education. ${ }^{7}$ The education effects for women are concentrated in primary school only, while men also see significant increases in lower and upper secondary education. As adults, men who are exposed to\nand Currie (2011) provide a review of the long-term effect on education of negative shocks while in utero or early childhood. In addition to the focus on the estimation of correlations between parent and child educational outcomes, recently there is an increased emphasis on estimating causal relationships. Researchers have used changes in school compulsory laws (see Chevalier, 2004 for U.K; Black, Devereux, and Salvanes, 2005 for Norway; Oreopoulos, Page, and Stevens, 2008 for U.S.), other educational policies (Currie and Moretti, 2003; Maurin and McNally, 2008), and environmental shocks (Black et al., forthcoming) to estimate these effects. There is however limited evidence from developing countries.\n${ }^{5}$ Recent research, conducted contemporaneously with ours, examines the effect of the same Indonesia school construction program on children's national primary school examination scores (Mazumder, Rosales-Rueda, and Triyana, 2019). They use the Indonesian Family Life Survey for their analysis, and in Section 3 and Appendix B, we highlight the reasons we instead use the National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) for studying intergenerational human capital impacts. In addition to the work by Duflo (2001), research by Breierova and Duflo (2004), MartinezBravo (2017), Rohner and Saia (2019), Karachiwalla and Palloni (2019), Ashraf, Bau, Nunn and Voena (2020), Hasan, Nakajima, and Rangel (2020), and Bazzi, Hilmy, and Marx (2020) measure various impacts of the school construction program in Indonesia. Wantchekon, Klasnja and Novta (2014) study human capital externalities after school construction in Benin.\n${ }^{6}$ On average, 1.98 schools were built per 1,000 children, which implies that at its mean value, the program would increase these indexes for women exposed to the school construction by 0.08 to 0.14 standard deviations relative to the control group for those outcomes where there is a statistically significant effect.\n${ }^{7}$ This finding is consistent with Breierova and Duflo (2004) who find similar point estimates for female education. In addition to the work by Duflo focusing on Indonesia, studies evaluating school construction projects have been carried out in Mozambique (Handa, 2002), Pakistan (Alderman, Kim, and Orazem, 2003), Afghanistan (Burde and Linden, 2013) and Burkina Faso (Kazianga et al., 2013). These studies focus on improvements in enrollment rates, as opposed to later-life outcomes, and all confirm large increases in school enrollment.",
      "5": "the program are more likely to be employed, to work in the formal sector, to work in the nonagricultural sector, and to migrate. Households with women exposed to the program have higher living standards, better housing, more assets, and pay more government taxes. While health investments increase, we do not observe improvements in health outcomes. School construction leads to improved marriage market outcomes with spouses being more educated and more likely to be literate. Positive impacts on household outcomes are driven by mother's program exposure rather than father's exposure.\n\nMothers transmit these effects to the next generation's children, who subsequently have more education, with larger impacts in secondary and tertiary education. Father's exposure to school construction does not have any effect on their children's education.\n\nTo quantify the policy implications, we conduct a cost-benefit analysis in which we create an accounting model to calculate the discounted costs of school construction and subsequent benefits for the government in terms of increased tax revenues and overall improved living standards for the Indonesian population. Across a range of different parameter estimates, we find that school construction leads to increased government tax revenues that directly offset construction costs within 30-54 years. Furthermore, accounting for improved living standards of the Indonesian population reveals high internal rates of return ranging from 13-18 percent and benefits surpassing costs within 18-28 years after the schools were built. These results provide strong support for the cost-effectiveness of school construction interventions. ${ }^{8}$\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the institutional context and school construction program in Indonesia. Section 3 describes the empirical identification strategy and the data. Section 4 presents the results examining the effects of exposure to school construction on a range of long-term outcomes and Section 5 discusses the intergenerational effects. Section 6 shows results of a number of robustness checks. Section 7 presents the costbenefit analysis and Section 8 concludes.\n\n# 2. Institutional Context \n\nIndonesia is the world's fourth most populous country and seventh largest economy in terms of GDP at purchasing power parity. The country experienced over 40 years of high growth. Starting with Soeharto in 1967, Indonesia's Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas) outlined plans for national development and poverty reduction in a series of Five-Year Development Plans (Repelita). One part of these plans included establishing the \"presidential instructions\" (INPRES) program, which set up a system for distributing revenues from the central government to lower administrative levels. Starting with the oil boom in 1973, the central government emphasized the explicit goal of reducing regional disparities (Ravallion, 1988).\n\nAs part of this redistribution goal, the government began a nationwide school construction program, the Sekolah Dasar INPRES, which was one of the first and largest INPRES programs. Between 1973 and 1979, around 61,800 primary schools were constructed. Enrollment rates in 1972 before the start of school construction were 71 percent among primary\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ Recent education research often focuses on evaluating demand-side interventions. These include information campaigns (see Jensen, 2010 providing information to parents about the returns to schooling), cash transfers (see Fiszbein et al. 2009 for an overview; Behrman, Parker, Todd, 2011 for evidence on the five-year impacts of the Mexican conditional cash transfer program Progresa; and Parker and Vogl, 2017 for evidence on Progresa's longerterm impacts; Baird et al., 2011, Akresh, de Walque, and Kazianga, 2013, 2016, and Benhassine et al., 2015 for research that explores the role of conditionality in these cash transfer programs), scholarships (see Kremer, Miguel, and Thornton, 2009 examining the impact of merit-based scholarships), or other household-level interventions (see Oster and Thornton, 2011 for evidence on providing female sanitary products to secondary school girls and Muralidharan and Prakash, 2017 for evidence from providing bicycles to families).",
      "6": "school-age children. By 1978, enrollment rates among this age group reached 85 percent. ${ }^{9}$ Prior to this program in 1973, capital expenditures in education were low and enrollment rates in the few years before school construction began were stagnant (World Bank, 1989).\n\nSchool construction nearly doubled the stock of primary schools from a baseline of around 63,000 primary schools. On average, the program added over 200 schools per district or 2 schools for every 1,000 children of primary school age. There was large heterogeneity across districts in how many schools the government built as the government designed the school construction program to target districts in which enrollment was initially lower. ${ }^{10}$ The government designed each school for 120 students, and they recruited teachers and paid their salaries for these newly constructed schools. During the same period, the government attempted to train new teachers, and the percentage of teachers who met the minimum qualification of having an upper secondary school degree did not change over this period (World Bank, 1989).\n\n# 3. Empirical Strategy and Data \n\n### 3.1 Difference-in-differences\n\nFollowing Duflo (2001), we estimate a difference-in-differences specification in which an individual's district of birth and date of birth jointly determine their exposure to the INPRES school construction program. Children in Indonesia typically attend primary school between age seven and twelve. INPRES school construction started during the 1973-1974 school year, so children who were born in or before 1962 were at least 12 years of age in 1974 and would not have benefited from the school construction. ${ }^{11}$ Children younger than seven in 1974 would have been exposed to the full potential benefits of the newly constructed schools. Children who were of primary school age in 1974 might partially benefit from the new INPRES schools as some of them were induced to enroll, and their propensity to enroll likely decreased with the child's age.\n\nBesides variation across birth cohorts, there is considerable variation across geographical districts in the intensity of the school construction program. This is because the number of schools constructed was linked to the districts' primary school enrollment rate in 1972 (prior to the school construction), and areas with low prior enrollment rates had more schools built.\n\nExploiting these two sources of variation (birth cohort and geographical), we estimate the effect of school construction in the following regression:\n\n$$\ny_{i j t}=\\alpha+\\beta \\text { School }_{j} \\cdot \\text { Young } g_{i t}+\\left(X_{j}^{i} \\boldsymbol{B}_{t}^{i}\\right) \\gamma_{t}+\\mu_{j}+\\delta_{t}+\\varepsilon_{i j t}\n$$\n\nwhere $y_{i j t}$ is the outcome of individual $i$ born in district $j$ in year $t$, School $_{j}$ measures the number of schools constructed by the INPRES program between 1973 and 1979 per 1,000 children in the individual's birth district $j$. We use an individual's birth district instead of current residence because the latter may be endogenous to program placement if households move to access schools for their children. ${ }^{12}$ Young $_{i t}$ is an indicator variable for being born between 1968-1972 (ages 2-6 in 1974) and thus being young enough to benefit from the program. Individuals born between 1957 and 1962 (ages 12-17 in 1974) represent older cohorts who are not exposed to the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ World Bank Databank. 2018. \"Adjusted Net Enrollment Rate, Primary (\\% of Primary School Age Children)\" (Accessed on October 17, 2018: databank.worldbank.org).\n    ${ }^{10}$ Appendix Figure A. 1 presents a map of Indonesia indicating the geographical distribution of the number of schools constructed in each district.\n    ${ }^{11}$ The 1993 Indonesian Family Life survey indicates that less than 3 percent of individuals born between 1950 and 1962 were still in primary school in 1974. As a further check, we use the 1976 Intercensal Survey and find that only 4.3 percent of individuals born between 1950 and 1962 were still in primary school in 1976.\n    ${ }^{12}$ In the African context, child fostering, where the biological parents send their own child to live with another family, is quite common and often done to send the child to school (Akresh, 2004, 2009). In the Indonesian context, child fostering is much less common (Marazyan, 2011).",
      "7": "program. Following Duflo (2001), we exclude individuals born between 1963 and 1967 (ages 711 in 1974) as they might have only partially benefited from school construction. We perform several robustness checks to confirm results are consistent across various definitions of exposed and unexposed cohorts. ${ }^{13} \\mu_{j}$ are time-invariant district of birth fixed effects, $\\delta_{t}$ are cohort of birth fixed effects, and $X_{j}^{l} \\boldsymbol{B}_{t}^{\\prime}$ controls for district-specific time-varying trends that might influence outcomes. Following Duflo (2001), we do this by interacting birth cohort indicators with children's population, district enrollment in 1971, and the presence of water and sanitation programs in the district. ${ }^{14}$ Note that Equation (1) closely follows the specification used by Duflo (2001) with the only exceptions that, unlike Duflo, we cluster our standard errors, and we do so at the district level, and that our data allows us to estimate the effects of school construction on both men and women. We explore first-generation individual-level outcomes to measure impacts of school construction. To allow for gender heterogeneity for individual-level outcomes, we estimate Equation (1) separately for men and women.\n\nMen and women's schooling are both affected by their birth district, and the marriage market is strongly impacted by school construction and plays a crucial role in the household and intergenerational effects. Our data show that over three-quarters of men and women in our sample have a partner from the same birth district and over 90 percent have a partner who came from the same type of program intensity region (either high or low), so the treatment for fathers is potentially correlated with the treatment for mothers. In order to independently measure the effects of school construction for the father and the mother, we adapt Equation (1) to include both male and female program exposure in the same regression. ${ }^{15}$ For household-level outcomes, such as expenditures, we therefore estimate:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y_{i j t}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1} \\text { School }_{j}^{\\text {male }} \\cdot \\text { Young }_{i t}^{\\text {male }}+\\beta_{2} \\text { School }_{j}^{\\text {female }} \\cdot \\text { Young }_{i t}^{\\text {female }}+\\left(X_{j}^{h h} \\boldsymbol{B}_{t}^{\\prime}\\right) \\gamma_{t} \\\\\n& +\\mu_{j}^{\\text {male }}+\\mu_{j}^{\\text {female }}+\\delta_{t}^{\\text {male }}+\\delta_{t}^{\\text {female }}+\\varepsilon_{i j t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nVariables are defined as previously, with superscripts now indicating if the number of schools constructed and the birth cohorts are in the man or woman's birth district. All regressions control for the man and woman's district of birth and cohort of birth fixed effects. $X_{j}^{h h} \\boldsymbol{B}_{t}^{\\prime}$ controls for district-specific time-varying trends in both the man and woman's birth district.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{13}$ One of the reasons for Duflo (2001) to restrict the young cohort to those born before 1972 is so that these cohorts would have completed schooling and begun participating in the labor market by 1995, the survey year of the data she uses. The 1972 cohorts turned 23 in 1995, which is old enough to have completed tertiary education. With our 2016 data, cohorts born after 1972 would have also been exposed to the school construction and had sufficient time to complete school and join the labor market. In the robustness checks discussed in Section 6, we explore the robustness of the results to alternative cohort definitions. In particular, we show that results are robust to adding in younger cohorts (born 1973-1980), older cohorts (born 1950-1956), and partially exposed cohorts (born 1963-1967). ${ }^{14}$ In line with Duflo (2001), we use district enrollment in 1971 because program intensity was tied to 1972 district enrollment and not controlling for pre-program enrollment might bias the results as there could be mean reversion even in the absence of the program. In addition, the oil boom, which provided financial resources for school construction, could have also provided resources for other government programs that were correlated with INPRES school placement. Water and sanitation programs were the second largest set of INPRES programs delivered by the central government.\n    ${ }^{15}$ A potential drawback of including both father and mother exposure in the same regression is that we have to restrict our regressions to households with both spouses present and both spouses have to be in either the old (19571962) or young (1968-1972) cohorts. This means we can no longer include divorcees, widows, or single parents. In robustness checks (results available upon request), we find that this change from the individual sample to the household sample is not driving any of our results.",
      "8": "The duration between school construction that started in 1973 and data collection in 2016 allows us to study not only the long-term effects of exposure to the program but also the effects of school construction on the next generation's outcomes. Specifically, we estimate the impact on children's schooling and other child outcomes based on whether their mother or father is exposed to school construction. We estimate reduced-form relationships between secondgeneration outcomes and school construction in the following regression:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& y_{i j t c a}=\\alpha+\\beta_{1} \\text { School }_{j}^{\\text {father }} \\cdot \\text { Young }_{i t}^{\\text {father }}+\\beta_{2} \\text { School }_{j}^{\\text {mother }} \\cdot \\text { Young }_{i t}^{\\text {mother }} \\\\\n&+\\left(Z_{j} \\boldsymbol{B}_{t}^{\\prime}\\right) \\gamma_{t}+\\mu_{j}^{\\text {father }}+\\mu_{j}^{\\text {mother }} \\\\\n&+\\delta_{t}^{\\text {father }}+\\delta_{t}^{\\text {mother }}+\\theta_{a}+\\varepsilon_{i j t c a}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $y_{i j t c a}$ denotes the outcome of child $c$ who is age $a$, born to a parent $i$ who was born in district $j$ in year $t$, School ${ }_{j}^{\\text {father }}$ and School ${ }_{j}^{\\text {mother }}$ are the number of schools constructed in the father's and mother's birth district respectively, and Young ${ }_{i t}^{\\text {father }}$ and Young ${ }_{i t}^{\\text {mother }}$ indicates if the father or mother belongs to the young cohort. All regressions control for the father and mother's district of birth and cohort of birth fixed effects. $\\theta_{a}$ is child $c$ 's age fixed effect. ${ }^{16} Z_{j} \\boldsymbol{B}_{t}^{\\prime}$ controls for district-specific time-varying trends in both the father and mother's birth district, as well as controlling for the child's potential direct exposure to school construction. ${ }^{17}$ Standard errors are calculated using multi-way clustering at the father and mother's birth district (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller, 2011). ${ }^{18}$\n\nGiven the program targeted less developed areas, we want to highlight that our effects are not explained by general catching up (or mean reversion) from those areas, as this would violate the parallel trends assumption. To test this identification assumption, we perform a number of robustness tests that we discuss in more detail in Section 6. First, we estimate placebo regressions in which we compare the 6 years belonging to the old cohort (ages 12 - 17 in 1974) with the 6 years belonging to an even older cohort (ages 18 - 23 in 1974), none of whom was exposed to school construction. As we discuss in Section 6.1 and show in Appendix Figure A.6, there are no differential time trends in outcomes prior to the school construction. Second, Appendix Figures A.2a to A.2e and A.3a and A.3b show event study graphs for which we interact the number of INPRES schools constructed in one's birth district with an indicator for age in 1974. We omit the age group 18-23 in 1974 from the regression so that we are comparing each age against this older cohort. For both men and women, we do not observe any differential\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{16}$ We include child age fixed effects because old cohort parents mechanically have older children on average than young cohort parents and older children have more time to complete additional schooling. Therefore, the marginal benefit to children's years of schooling is estimated across different households but among children of the same age. ${ }^{17}$ We assume that the INPRES schools last for 30 years, so that children starting school prior to 2003 could have been directly exposed to the original schools. Government plans originally estimated a 20-year school lifetime, but many schools were still in use beyond that period. We define the child's potential direct exposure as the number of schools constructed in the child's birth district interacted with a dummy for whether the child started school prior to 2003 when the INPRES schools would have been 30 years old. Robustness checks using alternative assumptions about INPRES school lifetimes ( $20,25,35$, and 40 years) yield consistent results. Likewise, estimating our main specification but excluding the child's potential direct exposure yields results that are consistent.\n    ${ }^{18}$ As in most household surveys, SUSENAS 2016 identifies household relationships with respect to the household head. If a child is not the biological or adopted child of the household head and spouse, the child is recorded as 'other household member'. Therefore, we restrict our intergenerational analysis to children of the household head and spouse.",
      "9": "trend effects for non-exposed ages. ${ }^{19}$ Third, we estimate placebo regressions for all subcomponents of second-generation education, shown in Appendix Table A.3. Fourth and finally, in Appendix Figures A.4a and A.4b, we present graphs for each index used in Figure 1 that highlight the parallel trends across birth cohorts in the high and low intensity districts. Taken together, and as described in more detail in Section 6, these robustness tests confirm the validity of the difference-in-differences specification.\n\n# 3.2 Strategies to address the large number of outcomes \n\nWe adopt two strategies to address the large number of outcomes that we examine to avoid overemphasizing any single significant result. First, as mentioned in the introduction, we create indexes for each family of outcomes following Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007). These indexes combine all of the outcomes in each family of outcomes. To construct the indexes, we define each outcome so that higher values correspond with better outcomes. Then we standardize each outcome into a Z-score by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the older cohort born in low intensity districts. We then average all of the Z-scores and standardize the average relative to the older cohort born in the low intensity districts. ${ }^{20}$ We then estimate the effect of exposure to school construction on these standardized outcome indexes.\n\nSecond, we correct for the potential issue of simultaneous inference using multiple hypothesis testing. Following Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), we use the concept of a false discovery rate (FDR) to allow inference when conducting many tests. Intuitively, FDR allows a researcher to tolerate a certain number of tests to be incorrectly discovered. An FDR adjusted qvalue of 0.05 implies that 5 percent of significant tests result in false positives compared with an unadjusted p -value of 0.05 that implies 5 percent of all tests result in false positives. In all regression tables, we show standard errors based on unadjusted p-values and FDR adjusted qvalues that address the multiple hypotheses being tested in a given family of outcomes.\n\n### 3.3 Data\n\nTo measure the impact of this school construction program, we use Duflo's data of the Sekolah Dasar INPRES program that reports the number of schools constructed in each district between 1973 and 1979. ${ }^{21}$ We combine the school construction data with the National Socioeconomic Survey conducted in 2016 (SUSENAS 2016) administered by Indonesia's Central Statistics Bureau, Badan Pusat Statistik. SUSENAS 2016 is a nationally representative household survey covering all 34 provinces and 511 districts of Indonesia. ${ }^{22}$ The data combines a large sample size of 291,414 households and 1,048,575 individuals with a wide range of variables on education, employment, migration, living standards, taxes, assets, nutrition, health, marriage and demographics, welfare program participation, and the next generation's educational outcomes. ${ }^{23}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{19}$ In our main analysis, we prefer to show results using the regression specifications rather than in figures that show treatment effects for each age separately because this allows us to pool together all ages that belong to the young cohort and all those that belong to the old cohort, given that within cohort, everyone has the same exposure status.\n    ${ }^{20}$ Banerjee et al. (2015) also use this approach to evaluate the effect of poverty graduation programs in six countries on a range of outcomes. Ajayi and Ross (2020) modify this standardization approach to use with a difference-indifferences empirical strategy when there is not a randomly assigned control group.\n    ${ }^{21}$ We are grateful to Esther Duflo for sharing these data.\n    ${ }^{22}$ The smallest geographical unit in the SUSENAS 2016 is the Indonesian 'kabupaten', loosely translated as district. ${ }^{23}$ SUSENAS 2016 is particularly suited to study this program's effects because it includes information on the individual's district of birth and the sample is sufficiently large to precisely estimate the observed relationships. Appendix B provides further rationale for the choice of data, in particular showing that the sample for the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) is too small to detect the effects of school construction. Bharati, Chin, and Jung (2018) use the most recent round of the IFLS to examine the combined impacts of rainfall at birth and school construction.",
      "10": "Appendix Table A. 1 provides variable descriptions in Tables 1-5, and Appendix Table A. 2 includes variable descriptions for all other outcomes. We present summary statistics by families of outcomes in Tables 1-5 and Appendix Table A.2, which we discuss in the next section together with the impacts of school construction. For the birth cohorts that our analysis focuses on (1957-1962 and 1968-1972), households have on average four members and the sample is evenly split between men and women. Average years of schooling for individuals in the control group is 7.3 years for men and 6.2 years for women. 76 percent of men and 67 percent of women complete primary school. These individuals have lower rates of lower and upper secondary school completion ( 27 and 23 percent for men respectively and 20 and 14 percent respectively for women). Tertiary completion rates are 10.2 and 7.0 percent for men and women. These individuals are ages 44 to 48 (young cohort) and 54 to 59 (old cohort) at the time of the survey in 2016. In the control group, most men are working ( 92 percent), while women have lower labor force attachment ( 60 percent). Conditional on working, only 30 percent of men and 21 percent of women are in the formal sector. Just over half of men and women work in nonagricultural sectors and slightly more than one-quarter have migrated from their birth district.\n\n# 4. First-Generation Effects of School Construction \n\nThis section describes the impact of school construction on first-generation outcomes. Following the estimation strategy previously outlined, the main explanatory variable is an interaction of the number of schools constructed per 1,000 children in a person's birth district with an indicator for being young enough to benefit from the program. As discussed in the introduction, Figure 1 reveals impacts of school construction across various indexes of outcomes for first-generation individuals exposed to the program and for their children. In the following sections, we discuss the family of outcomes that these indexes are based on in more detail.\n\n### 4.1. Impact on educational attainment\n\nTable 1 studies the relationship between school construction and educational attainment. ${ }^{24}$ On average, the program increases years of education for men by 0.27 years and for women by 0.23 years. The analysis by Duflo (2001) is restricted to men, and the comparable point estimate in her study is slightly lower at 0.19 years. ${ }^{25}$ Note that both estimates are modest in size given that the number of primary schools almost doubled. At the mean number of schools built per 1,000 children (1.98), our estimates imply an increase in years of schooling of 0.53 and 0.46 for men and women, respectively.\n\nThe next four columns examine completed levels of education and show considerable gender differences. For men, the program increases the likelihood of completing primary school by 2.6 percentage points. Even though the program only targeted primary schools, we see effects for men in lower and upper secondary education at 2.3 and 2.6 percentage points. ${ }^{26}$ These\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    They find strong effects of rainfall in the expected direction, but they confirm that the IFLS is underpowered to estimate the main effect of school construction on education or the interaction effect of construction and rainfall.\n    ${ }^{24}$ The survey records educational outcomes for household members aged five and older and is missing otherwise.\n    ${ }^{25}$ If we restrict our sample to only wage earners, our point estimate for men is 0.18 , while for this subgroup, Duflo's estimate is higher than ours at 0.26 . It is hard to pin down the exact reason for differences between Duflo's and our estimates given we use different surveys (Intercensal survey versus SUSENAS) in different years (1995 versus 2016). In Section 6.4, we discuss whether differential mortality could bias these results but do not find any evidence for that explanation.\n    ${ }^{26}$ Duflo (2001) also examines the effect on men's education beyond primary school. While Figure 2 of her paper only shows positive effects until grade 8 , the specification in this figure differs from her main regression analysis. In all regression analyses, she uses the continuous number of schools constructed in an individual's birth district, while for Figure 2, she only uses an indicator variable for whether an individual was born in a high program region. If we replicate Figure 2 using the 1995 SUPAS data that she uses, we find that using the continuous number of schools",
      "11": "represent larger percentage increases than for primary school because average completion rates at these levels are lower. On the other hand, the results for women are concentrated in primary school only, which they are 4.1 percentage points more likely to complete. At the mean number of schools built, these estimates imply an 8.2 percentage point increase in the likelihood of women completing primary school, which relative to the control group mean represents a 12.3 percent increase. The effects on lower and upper secondary completion rates are considerably smaller and indistinguishable from zero, and we are able to reject the equality of this coefficient with the male effect. For both men and women, school construction did not affect tertiary education completion rates. As shown in column 6, literacy rates in the control group are high on average at 95 percent for men and 91 percent for women, and the program raises these by 1.5 and 3.3 percentage points, respectively. The FDR q-values (shown in square brackets) that correct for multiple hypothesis testing across all of the outcomes in the education table reveal that the coefficients remain statistically significant.\n\nIn the last column, we create an index combining all other columns, following Kling et al. (2007) as discussed previously. The point estimates correspond with those shown in Figure 1 and confirm broad increases in educational attainment for men and women. Building two additional schools in an individual's birth district increases the educational outcomes for those exposed to the school construction by approximately 0.13 standard deviations relative to the control group. ${ }^{27,28}$\n\nAt first, our finding that the INPRES school construction program improved female education seems at odds with the results in Ashraf et al. (2020) who study how bride price customs affect investment in female education. We replicate their results measuring the overall effect of school construction on women's education, regardless of bride price tradition, using the same 1995 SUPAS data and regression specification they use. ${ }^{29}$ Results are shown in Appendix Table A.4. Column 1 shows the effect on years of schooling and column 2 on the likelihood of having completed primary education. Our results for women in column 2 are identical to column 1 of Table 6 in their paper. ${ }^{30}$ These two columns seem to suggest that school construction has no significant effect on women's years of schooling or primary school completion rates.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    constructed changes the pattern in Figure 2 and shows that that men exposed to the school construction program are more likely to complete school up through grade 11 in upper secondary school, and the effects are statistically significant. This is in line with our findings using the 2016 SUSENAS.\n    ${ }^{27}$ Comparing the effect sizes we find due to school construction with the existing literature shows that other programs have comparable impact. For example, Brune et al. (2020) find similar size effects on indexes of housing and debt due to a \"graduation\" model program in Yemen. Blattman et al. (2019) examine an anti-vote-buying campaign in Uganda and find slightly smaller magnitude treatment effects on a standardized index measuring people's perceptions of the community's willingness to accept vote-buying offers. Baldwin et al. (2020) evaluate a participatory development program in Ghana and find comparable effects on citizen's perceptions of the accountability of the village chief. Lastly, Dhar, Jain, and Jayachandran (2018) evaluate a school-based intervention in India that worked with adolescents to discuss gender equality, and they find program effects on a varianceweighted index of gender attitudes that is slightly larger than we find.\n    ${ }^{28}$ Other papers that have found positive effects of the INPRES school construction program on female education include Breierova and Duflo (2004), Mazumder et al. (2019), and Hasan et al. (2020). Hertz and Jayasundera (2007) do not find significant effects of female education, which we believe is because they use the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS). The IFLS is a relatively small sample that is underpowered to detect the effects of school construction on men and women, as we describe in more detail in Appendix B.\n    ${ }^{29}$ We thank Ashraf, Bau, Nunn, and Voena for generously sharing their data and code.\n    ${ }^{30}$ Ashraf et al. (2020) do not present results for years of schooling or for men.",
      "12": "In trying to understand the discrepancy with our results, it is important to note that Ashraf et al. (2020) use the 1995 SUPAS that is publicly available on IPUMS. ${ }^{31}$ The IPUMS sample only contains a subset of the data that leaves out all 15 provinces from the outer islands. ${ }^{32}$ However, the outer islands provide important variation in school construction, because the school construction program targeted areas with low initial school enrollment and the outer islands received a disproportionate number of schools built as shown on the map in Appendix Figure A.1. To understand if the IPUMS sample selection plays a role, we obtained access to the full 1995 SUPAS, an Inter-Census Population Survey that is nationally representative of Indonesia, and we show the effects in columns 3 and 4 of Appendix Table A.4. Both columns show that, when using the full 1995 SUPAS data, the school construction program had a strong and significant effect on female education measured in years of schooling ( 0.17 additional years of education) and primary school completion rates ( 2 percentage point increase). This leads us to believe that the effect of school construction on female educational outcomes is strong and positive and that limited geographical coverage explains the lack of significant effects in the IPUMS sample. ${ }^{33}$\n\nWe explore the gender dynamics and patterns by grade in further detail in Figure 2 showing the impact of school construction on the likelihood of completing at least a certain number of years of education. For example, it shows that the program increased the likelihood of completing at least one year of school by 0.95 percentage points for men and 2.3 percentage points for women. For men and women, effects are significantly different from zero throughout all primary school years and show an increasing pattern by grade. Consistent with Table 1, effects for men continue throughout lower and upper secondary school and seem stable across grades. While positive, the secondary school effects for women are not distinguishable from zero, nor are the effects on tertiary education for either gender. ${ }^{34}$\n\n# 4.2. Long-run labor market impacts \n\nHaving observed large increases in education in response to school construction, Table 2 studies subsequent labor market and migration outcomes due to the program. ${ }^{35,36}$ As shown in column 1, 92 percent of men are working and the program raises this by 0.6 percentage points. The effect for women is half as large and insignificant, but allows for an economically meaningful increase within its confidence bounds, especially considering a lower average employment rate of 60 percent. In column 2, we explore the intensive margin of employment, namely number of hours\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{31}$ Please see https://international.ipums.org/international-action/source_documents/enum_instruct_id1995a_tag.xml ${ }^{32}$ In total, Indonesia has 34 provinces, and amongst those not included are the islands and island groups of Kalimantan, Maluku, Sulawesi, and Papua.\n    ${ }^{33}$ We incorporate this discussion about the importance of geographical differences across data sets in order to reconcile our results with those in the rest of the literature. However, these geographical differences do not invalidate the results by Ashraf et al. (2020) because they focus on the distinction between ethnic groups who do and do not practice bride price traditions.\n    ${ }^{34}$ While we could use the school construction program as an instrument for years of education, we prefer to study later-life outcomes using OLS. There is a strong first stage relationship with an F-statistic of 32.3 for men and 31.8 for women. However, using OLS allows us to capture broad impacts and is more credible because the IV exclusion restriction could be violated if the program caused community-level changes that affect long-term outcomes in ways other than through increased schooling, such as a more educated peer group or better educated potential spouses. ${ }^{35}$ Employment outcomes are recorded for household members aged ten and older and are missing otherwise.\n    ${ }^{36}$ Heckman, Humphries, and Veramendi (2018) provide a recent overview of the extensive literature examining the relationship between education and labor market outcomes. Wydick, Glewwe and Rutledge (2013) find that child sponsorship leads to increased probability and quality of employment in six developing countries. Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer (2017) focuses on Ghana and is one of the few randomized control trials in education that follows individuals over eight years and finds that secondary school scholarships improve labor market outcomes.",
      "13": "worked conditional on working. Estimates indicate increases of 0.26 hours for men and 0.16 for women, but neither is significant. In response to school construction, men move to jobs that are generally deemed more desirable: they are 1.1 percentage points more likely to work in the formal sector that tends to offer higher quality and more stable jobs (Kleemans and Magruder, 2018). Given an average formal sector employment rate of 30 percent for men, increasing the number of schools in an individual's birth district by the sample mean raises the likelihood of men being in the formal sector by over 7 percent. Men also move away from agricultural work, which they are 1.2 percentage points less likely to hold and shift towards service sectors. We do not find any evidence of occupational shifts for women.\n\nMost research on the relationship between education and migration generally focuses on the selection into migration in terms of educational attainment. ${ }^{37}$ We contribute to this work by studying the relationship between the school construction program and migration. On average, 31 percent of men and 27 percent of women migrate away from their birth district. School construction increases migration rates by 0.7 and 0.8 percentage points, respectively. At the mean level of school construction, this represents an economically meaningful increase of 4.5 and 6.0 percent for men and women, respectively. Column 7 indicates that the increase in migration is concentrated in shorter distance moves within-rather than between—provinces.\n\nCorrecting for multiple hypothesis testing across all of the outcomes in the work/migration table shows that the FDR q-values are somewhat larger but men's coefficients generally remain statistically significant. Finally, aggregating the seven outcomes into an index following Kling et al. (2007) shows a positive and significant impact for men with an increase of 0.076 standard deviations due to an increase of two additional schools built in the district.\n\n# 4.3. Long-term impacts on living standards \n\nSUSENAS 2016 collects detailed data on household expenditures, which we use as a proxy for living standards. ${ }^{38}$ Table 3 shows the effects of exposure to school construction on three aggregated living standard measures and on total tax payments. Column 1 shows that total expenditure increases by 2.5 percent in households in which females are exposed, conditional on their spouse's exposure. ${ }^{39}$ The increase appears slightly larger for non-food than food expenditure (columns 2 and 3). These results remain statistically significant after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. The effects for males in the household are small and insignificant. Panel A of Appendix Table A. 2 provides further details on living standards and shows no significant effects on educational expenditure. The last row in Panel A combines the expenditure\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{37}$ Empirical evidence for Indonesia (Hamory et al., 2020) and for developing countries in general (Young, 2013) shows positive selection from rural to urban areas and negative selection from urban to rural.\n    ${ }^{38}$ SUSENAS 2016 does not include information on income, unlike the 1995 Intercensal survey that Duflo (2001) used to measure the returns to education. After the 1995 round, the earnings question was discontinued so we do not have access to more recent income data. That said, in a developing country setting with substantial home production, informal employment, unemployment, and underemployment, expenditure data may suffer less from underreporting and more closely resemble living standards (Rizky, Suryadarma, and Suryahadi, 2019). All expenditure values refer to average monthly expenditure measured in 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (IDR). In 2016, the exchange rate was 1 USD=13,308 IDR. We convert expenditure categories reported in weekly or annual amounts to monthly expenditure. In regression analyses, we apply an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation to the nominal values since expenditure data tends to be skewed and a log transformation would not be defined for zero expenditures. The inverse hyperbolic sine is approximately equal to $\\log (2 y)$ or $\\log (2)+\\log (y)$, so in most cases it can be interpreted the same way as a standard logarithmic dependent variable.\n    ${ }^{39}$ As detailed in Section 3.1, all household-level regressions include men and women's program exposure.",

Column 4 of Table 3 shows that total taxes increase by 6.4 percent in households where females are exposed to school construction, which remains statistically significant after multiple hypothesis testing correction. In Appendix Table A.2, Panel B (rows 2, 3 , and 4), we analyze the three main sub-components of taxes and the last row combines these into a tax index. Households with women exposed to school construction see an increase of 0.037 standard deviations in the tax index, driven by increased vehicle taxes. ${ }^{41,42}$\n\nAnother component of living standards concerns people's health and nutrition. Panels D, E, and F of Appendix Table A. 2 show three components of health impacts in response to school construction. Panel D shows no effects on household nutrition (calories, protein, fat, or carbohydrates) for men or women exposed to the program. Overall, health investments improve as shown in Panel E for households where the woman was exposed to school construction. Using detailed data from various types of health investments, the health investment index shows broad increases for households with exposed women, with an improvement in health investments of 0.10 standard deviations when an additional two schools are built in the individual's birth district. These health investment increases appear to be due to large increases in private hospital expenditures, which generally provide higher quality and more expensive health care.\n\nWhile there are increases in overall health investments, Panel F reveals that there are small improvements in not experiencing a severe health complaint but only for men exposed to\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{40}$ We estimate all regressions using expenditure data with an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (IHS). While this is typical to analyze expenditures, in Appendix Table A.5, we show robustness checks using alternative transformations of total expenditures. Column 1 repeats the results from Table 3, column 1 using an IHS transformation. Column 2 uses the log of nominal expenditures; column 3 uses nominal expenditures. Results are similar in both cases. In column 4, we estimate household per capita instead of total expenditure (using an IHS transformation) to capture potential changes in household structure that could be correlated with exposure. Effects are smaller and no longer statistically significant.\n    ${ }^{41}$ Panel C of Appendix Table A. 2 explores effects on housing and assets. 48 percent of the control group lives in urban areas and even though exposure increases migration, school construction does not increase the likelihood of living in urban areas. Households with women exposed to school construction appear to move to more valuable housing. Row 2 shows an increase of 3.9 percent in the monthly rent equivalent payments and row 4 an increase in utility usage by 8.3 percent, but these do not survive corrections for multiple hypothesis testing. We do not observe effects on other housing characteristics nor on an asset index that is created using a principal component analysis of household ownership of the following durable goods: ownership of motorcycle, car, home phone, computer/laptop, television, gold/jewelry, refrigerator, water heater, LPG gas tube, boat, motorized boat, and air conditioner. Aggregating all five housing and asset outcomes into an index in row 6 shows a 0.04 standard deviation increase if women in the household are exposed. There are no effects for men's exposure on housing and assets.\n    ${ }^{42}$ In determining why certain outcomes are in the appendix and others are in the main text, we made that decision based on what we believe to be one of the key contributions of the paper, which is our focus on second-generation educational outcomes. To support that contribution, we first explore the impacts on first-generation educational outcomes. The other tables in the main text are focused on the main channels through which education could be transferred inter-generationally, including through the labor market, marriage market, and household living standards. The SUSENAS 2016 covers a wide variety of topics that are divided into blocks, and in our paper, we created a table for each topic. These are presented in Appendix Table A.2, each as a different panel. If a topic was clearly outside of the scope of our paper, for example crime or smoking behaviors or internet usage, we did not include it. In order to be transparent and exactly because the survey covers so many topics, we present all of the outcomes we analyzed in the appendix and do not restrict the tables to only present significant coefficients.",

The aggregated health index in row 4 shows an improvement in health outcomes for men exposed to school construction but is insignificant for exposed women. ${ }^{43}$\n\n# 4.4. Long-run marriage and fertility effects \n\nEvidence estimating the causal relationship between education and demographic outcomes has generally been mixed and nuanced. ${ }^{44}$ Table 4 explores marriage and fertility outcomes for those exposed to the program. On average, women marry 4.6 years younger than men (column 1), but there is no effect of school construction exposure on the age of first marriage. Coefficients are small and statistically insignificant. In columns 2 to 9 , we explore if program exposure changed the types of spouses that men and women marry. Columns 2, 3, and 4 reveal that both men and women marry partners with higher levels of education and literacy. Results remain statistically significant after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. The results are perhaps unsurprising given that average education levels improved in districts with additional schools, but important nonetheless because education increases for exposed individuals as well as their spouses. ${ }^{45}$ As shown in columns 5, 6, and 7, we do not observe any changes in the labor market outcomes of spouses, but we do see that men and women are $0.7-0.8$ percentage points more likely to have a spouse who migrated (column 8). ${ }^{46}$ We do not observe changes in spouse's health (column 9).\n\nWe do not have complete birth histories for each woman that would allow us to measure the relationship between education and total fertility. However, we can measure impacts on the number of children aged $0-14$ living in the household at the time of the survey. Exposure to school construction reduces the number of children for women. The combined marriage and fertility index (column 11) shows broad improvements for both genders: two additional schools built in a district lead to increases of 0.13 and 0.10 standard deviations for exposed men and women. ${ }^{47}$\n\n## 5. Second-Generation Effects of School Construction\n\nHaving observed large long-term effects of Indonesia's school construction program on a wide range of outcomes, including education, employment, migration, living standards, and marriage,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{43}$ We also explore the effects of exposure to school construction on the first-generation's utilization of government welfare programs. SUSENAS 2016 collects data on four national programs that aim to reduce poverty and inequality. Ex-ante it is unclear if increased take-up of welfare programs reflects higher needs due to increased poverty or whether it is indicative of increased awareness of existing programs. As shown in Panel G of Appendix Table A.2, we see few changes to any of the individual government programs or to the welfare program index in the last row.\n    ${ }^{44}$ Osili and Long (2008) find evidence of education reducing fertility in Nigeria. On the other hand, McCrary and Royer (2011) find only a small fertility effect but a larger effect on the quality of the marriage partner in the U.S. In the Kenyan context, education subsidies reduce women's likelihood of teenage marriage and pregnancy (Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer, 2015). Looking at a wider age range, Geruso and Royer (2018) find increased education lowers teen fertility and increases the education of the spouse but has no impact on total completed fertility. Research by Breierova and Duflo (2004) examining this same Indonesian school construction program find that women exposed to the program have lower fertility, consistent with our results discussed below.\n    ${ }^{45}$ We find suggestive evidence that this is not just a level effect (everyone has more education) but also a distributional effect (husbands marry women from higher in the education distribution).\n    ${ }^{46}$ We define migration relative to the individual's birth district, and it may have occurred anytime between birth and 2016, so spouses may have migrated together.\n    ${ }^{47}$ While Table 4 follows Equation (1) used for individual-level outcomes, Appendix Table A. 6 includes male and female program exposure simultaneously, according to Equation (1'). Both tables show spousal education and the marriage index improving in response to the program. Despite controlling for the spouse's program exposure in Appendix Table A.6, the direct effect of the policy on marriage market outcomes remains, although the magnitudes of the effects are smaller in the regressions that control for female program exposure. This seems to indicate that part of the improvements of her marriage market outcomes was due to improvements in the general population of marriage partners.",
      "16": "we now investigate whether the effects extend to the next generation and affect the children of those exposed to the program. Our second-generation empirical analysis highlights that any empirical association between parent and child schooling need not reflect a direct relationship only, but may also manifest itself through positive assortative matching. ${ }^{48}$ Indeed, Table 4 and Appendix Table A. 6 (discussed in the previous section) show that individuals exposed to school construction match with higher educated spouses. ${ }^{49}$\n\nIn Section 5.1, we study the impact of parental exposure to school construction on their children's schooling. In Section 5.2, we perform a mediation analysis using the rich data we have available to see how controlling for additional parental characteristics changes the effect of parental exposure on their children's schooling. This helps shed light on the potential mechanisms through which parental exposure affects child's schooling. Lastly, in Section 5.3, we discuss potential selection issues regarding the second-generation sample of individuals.\n\n# 5.1. Second-generation effects on education and well-being \n\nAs explained in Section 3, we measure second-generation impacts using the same difference-indifferences framework as first-generation effects. The main explanatory variable is an interaction of school construction intensity in a parent's birth district with an indicator for being young enough to benefit from the program. We include both father's and mother's program exposure, and we consider outcomes for all children living in the parent's household. All regressions control for father's and mother's district of birth and cohort of birth fixed effects, as well as child age fixed effects (to ensure comparisons are across same-aged children), and for whether the second-generation child was potentially directly exposed to school construction. We restrict the sample to children who are 35 years old or younger by 2016 (i.e. born in or after 1981) to ensure that there is no overlap between the first- and second-generation sample.\n\nIn Figure 3, we first explore if school construction had second-generation effects at different grade levels. We estimate the likelihood of a second-generation child completing at least a certain number of years of school. We examine, within a household, whether the effects depend on if the father or mother is exposed to school construction. Results confirm that program effects persist into the next generation. Exposure to school construction by mothers has an overall larger effect on their children's education than fathers' exposure. We observe the largest effects on grades in upper secondary. When examining each grade separately, for many grades, we cannot statistically distinguish the results by gender of the parent, but as we discuss below in Table 5, when grouping the grades by education level we are able to highlight that mothers have a statistically larger effect than fathers do.\n\nTable 5 shows the effect of parental exposure to school construction on their children's educational attainment. Results indicate that there are intergenerational effects due to school construction. ${ }^{50}$ Mother's exposure to school construction improves second-generation educational outcomes, while there does not appear to be any relationship with father's program\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{48}$ Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002) caution that studying intergenerational schooling externalities is also challenging due to ability bias, which points to parent ability as an omitted variable determining both their own schooling and their child's ability and through that, the child's schooling. Studying effects in response to school construction helps eliminate this concern and obtain causal estimates of second-generation effects.\n    ${ }^{49}$ On average, the correlation in years of education between spouses is high at 0.63 .\n    ${ }^{50}$ Related research explores the production function for children's human capital (Attanasio, Meghir, and Nix, 2017) as well as focuses on how parents or teachers respond to inequalities across children (Akresh et al., 2012, PopEleches and Urquiola, 2013).",
      "17": "exposure. ${ }^{51}$ Children with mothers exposed to the program obtain an additional 0.17 years of school, while there is no effect for children with exposed fathers. We can reject the equality of these coefficients. For women, the magnitude decreases compared to the first-generation results of 0.23 years but is still economically meaningful. For men, the effect is small and statistically not significant highlighting the importance of the marriage market for next generation outcomes. ${ }^{52}$\n\nUnlike the first-generation education results, we observe no second-generation effects for primary school completion rates (column 2) because by 2016 primary school became nearly universal. ${ }^{53}$ There are large effects on completing lower and upper secondary for children whose mothers are exposed to school construction, with no effect for exposed fathers. We are able to reject the equality of father's and mother's coefficients for lower secondary, but standard errors are larger in the upper secondary regression and we are not able reject equality at standard thresholds. In addition, unlike the first-generation education results, increases in educational attainment now extend to tertiary education. Children with exposed mothers are 0.9 percentage points more likely to complete tertiary education. An increase of the mean number of schools in a mother's birth district leads to a 13 percent increase in the likelihood her child completes tertiary education relative to the control group's tertiary education levels. Since some secondgeneration children may still be attending school, we study the effects on age-for-grade (column 6), defined as an indicator variable for whether the child is on track to complete the appropriate grades on time. ${ }^{54}$ Results confirm that having a mother exposed to school construction increases the likelihood of being on track by 1.5 percentage points. Similar calculations as above show increases of $3,4,6$, and 4 percent respectively in years of schooling, lower secondary, upper secondary, and age-for-grade due to mother's program exposure. ${ }^{55}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{51}$ When we run these regressions for second-generation educational outcomes and only include father's exposure (and not mother's exposure), the coefficient for father's exposure is large and statistically significant. This suggests that for fathers any observed effect of program exposure works through his spouse's characteristics and the marriage market and not through direct paternal exposure.\n    ${ }^{52}$ We face several challenges with our identification strategy that focuses on young (born 1968-1972) and old (born 1957-1962) cohorts. For households to be in the regression, a child's father and mother must be in the household and both need to be in these specific birth cohorts. Estimating regressions that only include mother's program exposure yields a larger sample, and results remain consistent (available on request). We also test the robustness of this selection issue by expanding the range of birth cohorts included in the regressions to include all individuals born between 1950 and 1980. All birth cohorts born after 1968 could be exposed to the school construction that began in 1973. Both parents no longer need to be part of the young and old cohorts as previously defined. The sample size expands to 244,395 second-generation children with parents in this extended cohort range. Results are consistent with mother's exposure to school construction increasing her child's education more than father's exposure.\n    ${ }^{53}$ UNICEF statistics (accessed November 19, 2018: unicef.org/infobycountry/indonesia_statistics) indicate primary school net enrollment rates in Indonesia from 2008-2012 are 98 and 100 percent for boys and girls, respectively.\n    ${ }^{54}$ The indicator variable is zero for those who did not start school by age 7 or had to repeat one or more grades before completing upper secondary education, which is compulsory in Indonesia. The indicator variable is one for those who have already completed upper secondary school or are on track to do so in a timely manner.\n    ${ }^{55}$ In Appendix Table A.7, we explore if parental exposure has different effects for sons and daughters. Panel A includes only sons and Panel B only daughters. Across the different educational outcomes, father's program exposure shows a small and statistically insignificant effect for both sons and daughters. Mother's program exposure shows a substantially larger effect than father's program exposure across all education outcomes and for both sons and daughters. The benefit to daughters' years of schooling is five times larger if their mother rather than their father is exposed to school construction and thirteen times larger for completed upper secondary. Despite the smaller sample sizes, we are able to reject equality of the father and mother coefficients in a number of cases (for sons for years of schooling, completed lower secondary, and the second-generation education index, and for daughters for completed upper secondary).",
      "18": "After correcting for multiple hypothesis testing, the education results for mothers remain statistically significant for years of schooling, upper secondary, and age-for-grade, while completed lower secondary and tertiary now have p-values of 0.11 indicating we are no longer able to reject equality between the mother's and father's coefficients. We aggregate the six outcomes into a second-generation education index, and it shows large increases for children with mothers exposed to school construction. An increase of two additional schools built in the mother's birth district increases their children's educational attainment by 0.07 standard deviations relative to parents who are not exposed to the program. ${ }^{56}$\n\n# 5.2. Channels for intergenerational persistence of education \n\nTo understand better the potential mechanisms through which parental exposure to school construction affects second-generation child schooling, we perform a mediation analysis. Results are shown in Appendix Table A.8. Column 1 repeats the effects of parent exposure on children's years of schooling from Table 5. Subsequent columns add indexes from Figure 1 as control variables through which parental exposure could manifest itself. In each regression, we add mediators for both the father and mother (or the household depending on the mediation variable). Naturally, the additional regressors are endogenous to the program and we are not able to control for all relevant characteristics, but given our rich data, we, nonetheless, believe a mediation analysis is insightful.\n\nIn columns 2, 3, and 4, we explore the role of parental health characteristics. Mediators include the parent's health outcomes, nutrition, and health investments. Mother's program exposure remains statistically significant and of the same magnitude when these mediators are included. Columns 5, 6, and 7 control for household levels of taxes, housing/assets, and living standards. The point estimates for mother's program exposure are smaller by 12-17 percent highlighting that some of the program effect is coming through overall household well-being. Column 8 shows that adding the father and mother's work and migration index does not change the effect of mother's program exposure.\n\nIn column 9, we control for the individual's marriage index, which includes spouse characteristics as well as age of first marriage and household size. This leads to a 26 percent drop in the direct effect of mother's program exposure on her children's education. This is consistent with the previous section's finding that the marriage market and spousal characteristics have a large impact on the intergenerational transmission of education. There is still no effect of father's program exposure. We do not observe many potential channels in the data through which these effects could manifest themselves, for example through increased encouragement to attend school or study. We cannot distinguish between these channels, but based on this table, we conclude there remains a direct effect from mothers to their children that is not explained by changes in own characteristics.\n\n### 5.3 Selection of second-generation individuals\n\nTwo data issues are relevant for the second-generation analysis and the selection of individuals in the regressions. First, there is a tradeoff between the selection of who remains in a household, and is therefore in the survey, and what age they finish higher levels of school. Focusing only on younger children reduces the selection bias as few of them leave the household by that age, but\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{56}$ Having observed educational increases for children with mothers exposed to the program, Appendix Table A. 2 Panel H explores effects on children's employment and self-reported health. Rows 1 and 2 examine the number of days and hours not engaged in work. We do not observe any changes in days or hours worked if either the father or mother is exposed. Rows 3, 4, and 5 study second-generation health effects. Father's or mother's exposure does not affect children's health. Aggregating these employment and health indicators into a second-generation well-being index shows no effect for children whose fathers or mothers are exposed.",
      "19": "they are not old enough to complete higher levels of schooling, which are important to study since primary school is nearly universal in 2016. We therefore include all children 35 years old and younger, and test whether there are differences in the effects between various secondgeneration age cohorts. In addition to that, we always include age fixed effects to ensure we compare those of the same age.\n\nTo test whether there are any differences across second-generation age cohorts, we estimate a fully interacted model where the main differences-in-differences variables for fathers and mother's program exposure are interacted with dummies for the child's age range (ages 6-12 (omitted category), ages 13-18, ages 19-25, and ages 26 and above). Results are presented in Appendix Table A.9. Each column in the table shows a regression of an education outcome for a second-generation child on parent's exposure to the school construction program. The main effects of father's and mother's program exposure are the regression coefficients of father or mother's young cohort dummy interacted with the number of schools constructed in father or mother's district of birth. All regressions control for all double interactions as well as all of the controls in the second-generation regressions shown in Table 5. Results in Appendix Table A. 9 for the main effect of mother's program exposure have a positive and significant effect on all second-generation education outcomes (except for completed primary). There are no effects of father's program exposure on second-generation children. The triple interaction terms show that there are no differences in the effects of father's or mother's program exposure for the young cohort and those belonging to the age groups 13-18, 19-25, or 26 and above (only 1 out of 36 coefficients is significant at the 10 percent level).\n\nSecond, SUSENAS 2016, like most household surveys, only includes information on individuals currently residing in a given household but not on family members living elsewhere. For second-generation children who are no longer living with their parents, perhaps because they started a new household, we cannot link them to their biological parents, and we do not know if the parents of these children are exposed to the program. For this reason, we based all secondgeneration analyses thus far on those still living with their parents. We next explore robustness of the results under various assumptions about the children who have left the household.\n\nTo do this, we conduct two bounding analyses. The first simulates exposure assignment for all non-co-resident children. ${ }^{57}$ To address the selection issue about co-resident secondgeneration children observed in the SUSENAS data, we use the Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) that does well in tracking individuals over time and matching parents to children who moved away. ${ }^{58}$ We use these data to obtain the fraction of children at each age born to old and young cohort parents among all children no longer living with their parents. We use these IFLSbased fractions to randomly assign non-co-resident children at each age in the SUSENAS data to either old or young cohort parents and exclude the others from the regression. ${ }^{59}$ We simulate this\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{57}$ For children living away from their parents, we must assume the parent's birth district and birth year to determine the parent's exposure. As we have no other information, we assume the parent's and child's birth district are the same. To test this assumption's robustness, we estimate Table 5 using a child's instead of parent's birth district, and results are consistent, albeit weaker. In the main regressions, we include birth year fixed effects, but it is harder to predict parent's birth year given only a child's age, so we now include an indicator variable for whether the parent is in the young cohort. Estimating Table 5 replacing birth year dummies with a young cohort dummy yields consistent results. We maintain the exposure status of children who still live with their parents.\n    ${ }^{58} 87.8$ percent of individuals surveyed in the 1993 first wave were tracked or deceased by the last wave in 2014/5. We match 91 percent of children in the last wave's household roster to their co-resident or non-co-resident parents.\n    ${ }^{59}$ Results are consistent if we use the fraction of non-co-resident children at each age and gender who are born to old and young cohort parents and use these age-gender based fractions to draw random samples in the SUSENAS.",
      "20": "randomization assignment procedure 1,000 times and estimate the second-generation years of schooling regression. Appendix Figure A. 5 shows the distribution of coefficients from these 1,000 repetitions for father and mother's exposure to school construction. Effect sizes for father's exposure on their children's years of schooling range from 0.010 to 0.053 at the $5^{\\text {th }}$ and $95^{\\text {th }}$ percentiles with a median coefficient of 0.033 . Effect sizes for mother's exposure are larger, ranging between 0.048 and 0.086 with a median coefficient of $0.067 .{ }^{60}$\n\nSecond, we repeat the second-generation analysis directly using the IFLS. We begin by estimating whether program exposure is correlated with co-residency. Results in column 1 of Appendix Table A. 10 show there is no relationship between father or mother program exposure and the second-generation child being co-resident. The last three columns in this table estimate the effect of father's and mother's program exposure on years of schooling for all children, only those living with their parents, and those who moved away. Those living with their parents provides the closest comparison to our SUSENAS sample. Across all three samples, we find no statistically significant effect for fathers exposed to school construction. The estimated effect of mother's exposure is 0.555 in the sample of children still living with their parents compared to 0.417 in the sample of all children. This suggests an effect only 75 percent as large if we are unable to include non-co-resident children in the analysis. Scaling down our estimate of mother's exposure in Table 5 by this magnitude yields an estimated effect of 0.125 additional years of schooling, which is still economically meaningful.\n\n# 6. Robustness Checks \n\nIn this section, we present a set of specification checks highlighting the robustness of our results.\n\n### 6.1 Placebo tests and parallel trends\n\nOur identification assumption is that the change in outcomes across birth cohorts in districts that built many schools would have been the same in the absence of the program as the change across birth cohorts in districts that built fewer schools. However, educational patterns between birth cohorts could vary systematically across districts. To test this assumption, we estimate placebo regressions comparing old cohorts (ages 12-17 in 1974) and even older cohorts (ages 18-23 in 1974). If the assumption holds, then any change in outcomes between cohorts in these groups, both of whom were not exposed to the program, should not differ across districts. Appendix Figure A. 6 presents the results from estimating placebo regressions for each of the indexes for every family of outcomes (similar to Figure 1). For all indexes, the placebo regressions show no statistically significant effects, suggesting that the main difference-in-differences results are not driven by a failure of the identification assumption. As an additional test, we estimate placebo regressions for all subcomponents of second-generation education and show results in Appendix Table A.3. In line with Appendix Figure A.6, only one of the 14 coefficients is statistically significant at the 10 percent level, and all others are insignificant, further validating the identification strategy.\n\nWe furthermore add various event study graphs to rule out differential time trends. We do so in two ways. First, we add figures showing how the treatment effect changes across cohorts and we show these for all indexes of the main tables. Appendix Figures A.2a-A.2e show these for first-general outcomes and A.3a-A.3b, for second-generation outcomes.

      "21": "have more statistical power when pooling across ages by young and old cohort in the regressions). These event studies show a consistent pattern of no treatment effects for unexposed cohorts (ages 12 and up), a gradual increase in the effect from ages 11 to 7 as these cohorts were partially exposed, and larger treatment effects for younger ages, who benefitted from school construction. Second, we show parallel trends figures for each of the 12 indexes and compare old and young cohorts in high and low program intensity areas. These parallel trends figures are shown for men and women in Appendix Figures A.4a and A.4b, respectively, and further validate our empirical estimation strategy.\n\n# 6.2 Possible general equilibrium effects \n\nThe analysis presented so far exploits variation across districts and cohorts to identify partial equilibrium school construction effects. This raises the concern that general equilibrium effects might undo direct program effects (Heckman, Lochner, and Taber, 1998). If school construction increases the young cohort's education in high intensity districts, this could affect non-exposed individuals (either young cohorts in low intensity districts or older cohorts). Depending on how these general equilibrium effects work and whether they have a negative or positive effect depends on the substitutability or complementarity between old and young cohorts.\n\nSchool construction leads to more educated young workers. If those workers are substitutes for the older cohorts in the labor market, then this increase could drive down wages for the older cohorts who are competing with them for jobs in those locations. If that happens, then the effects we observe in our specification for improved living standards for the young relative to the old cohort would be over-estimating the true effect of the program. Duflo (2004) suggests that such general equilibrium effects might have occurred in Indonesia, although the magnitudes of the bias appear to be rather small. Focusing on the instrumental variables specification she estimates, she finds that an increase of 10 percentage points in the share of primary school graduates leads to a 2.9-3.8 percent decrease in wages for the old cohorts. Given that we observe an increase of only 2.6 percentage points in the likelihood of completing primary school for men, the subsequent old cohort wage decreases would be less than 1 percent. Adjusting our estimates by that magnitude does not significantly alter our results. In addition, if we adjust by this magnitude the cost-benefit calculations discussed in Section 7, it would not affect our overall interpretation of the benefits of school construction.\n\nAlternatively, if the young cohorts are complements for the old cohorts (for instance, because they start more businesses and hire older cohort individuals or because they spend more money on goods and services produced by the older cohorts), then the older cohorts benefit by having more educated younger cohorts in their location. If these effects dominate the general equilibrium impact, we would underestimate the true effect.\n\nIn order to help us distinguish between these competing stories of complementarity and substitutability among old and young cohorts, we turn to a paper by Khanna (2015) that studies an educational reform in the 1990s and early 2000s in India. The District Primary Education Program has many similarities with the INPRES school construction program in Indonesia, because it also included construction of primary schools and targeted low-literacy regions. While Duflo (2004), discussed above, shows effects on average wages, Khanna (2015) is able to estimate generation equilibrium effects on each skill-group separately. In our setting, it is challenging to recover the general equilibrium effects when using a difference-in-differences framework because the portion that affects both the young and old cohorts is differenced out. Instead, Khanna (2015) uses a regression discontinuity design, and building on a general",
      "22": "equilibrium model, he is able to disentangle effects into the portion that affects all cohorts and impacts for separate cohorts and skill groups.\n\nKhanna (2015) finds sizeable general equilibrium effects and important differences for those exposed and unexposed to the program. For treated cohorts, he shows that general equilibrium effects reduce returns to skill by 32 percent and dampen the labor market benefits by 23 percent. Given that we measure outcomes in 2016, the impact we measure on exposed individuals is the overall effect and already includes both individual effects and general equilibrium effects. ${ }^{61}$ In order to understand how general equilibrium effects may bias our estimates, we need to focus on how unexposed individuals were affected. Importantly, Khanna (2015) finds that by expanding the skilled workforce, the policy makes skilled workers worse off and unskilled workers better off. If this extends to the Indonesian context, evidence about unskilled workers benefiting implies that older cohorts who were more likely to be lower educated and unskilled would have benefited from these general equilibrium effects. As a result, we would underestimate the true effect.\n\nUltimately, we cannot know for sure if this conclusion extends to the Indonesian context and the evidence on general equilibrium effects from developed countries (Angrist, 1995; Crepon et al., 2013; Bianchi, 2018) is likely less relevant for understanding the Indonesian context over the past four decades. In our case, we can turn to the placebo analysis shown in Appendix Figure A6 to explore if potential negative general equilibrium effects bias our results. This figure compares those belonging to the old cohort (ages 12-17 in 1974) to those belonging to the even older cohorts (ages 18 - 24 in 1974), none of whom benefited from school construction. Unless both of these cohorts are equally affected by negative general equilibrium effects, the placebo would fail, with the direction of the placebo effect depending on who is most substitutable to the young cohort, e.g. who would be most negatively impacted by general equilibrium effects. For example, if it is the case that individuals closer in age are closer substitutes to each other, then those belonging to the old cohort (ages 12-17 in 1974) are closer substitutes to the young cohort exposed to the program, than those belonging to the even older cohort (ages 18-24 in 1974). While it is not definitive because age substitutability is ultimately unknown, if general equilibrium effects more negatively impact the old cohort, we would see a negative effect in the placebo regression comparing old to even older cohorts. This is not what we observe in any of the indexes in Appendix Figure A6. These results are corroborated by the event study graphs shown in Appendix Figures A.2a to A.2e that show treatment effects by cohort relative to the age group 18-23 and do not show systematic trend breaks comparing the old to the even older cohort.\n\nLikewise, in the case of the marriage market, the young cohort who receives more education may be deemed more desirable on the marriage market. Since people tend to marry individuals closer in age, those belonging to the old cohort (ages 12-17 in 1974) may face more competition from the young cohort, than those belonging to the even older cohort (ages 18-24 in 1974). ${ }^{62,63}$ If general equilibrium effects negatively impact the old cohort (ages 12-17 in 1974),\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{61}$ Duflo (2001) makes a similar argument stating, \"Note that the returns to education are measured in 1995. If the program was large enough to have general equilibrium effects on the returns to education, this will therefore be reflected in the estimates.\"\n    ${ }^{62}$ After all, the age difference between the young cohort (ages 2-6 in 1974) and even older cohort (ages 18-24 in 1974) is at least 12 years, so they are less likely to be substitutes on the marriage market.\n    ${ }^{63}$ Marriage markets tend to be fairly localized, with over three-quarters of men and women having a partner from the same birth district and over 90 percent having a partner who came from the same type of school construction intensity region (either high or low), so general equilibrium effects across geographic areas might be less relevant.",
      "23": "then we would expect the placebo regression for the marriage market index in Appendix Figure A. 6 to show negative effects. However, we do not observe this. Nor do we see a differential trend when comparing the old to the even older cohort in the event study graph of the marriage index in Appendix Figure A.2e.\n\n# 6.3 Multiple hypothesis testing \n\nIn our efforts to address the potential statistical problems with analyzing many outcomes, as previously discussed, we calculate aggregate indexes across families of outcomes and we compute FDR adjusted q-values across families of outcomes to deal with multiple hypothesis testing. In this section, we examine whether our FDR corrections are sufficiently conservative. Much of the economics literature that uses FDR corrections to deal with multiple hypothesis testing also adjusts the standard errors within families of outcomes, and those families are usually not defined a priori (see recent papers by Heller et al. (2017), Parker and Todd (2017), and Christensen et al. (2020)). In our case, however, since each of the families of outcomes correspond with a series of questions from a module in the survey instrument (e.g. education, work, living standards, marriage market, and second-generation education), we feel that the decision of how we define a family is defensible. Despite this, we further explore how much this decision matters for our interpretation of the results. We recalculate the FDR in two more conservative, alternative ways. Results are presented in Appendix Table A.11, which shows the coefficients for the treatment effects for men and women exposed to school construction corresponding to the indexes shown in Figure 1. First, we focus on the 12 indexes and calculate an FDR adjusted q-value computed separately over the first-generation indexes and over the second-generation indexes (presented in square brackets). Results remain statistically significant for the indexes in our main tables (first-generation education index, work/migration index, marriage market index, and second-generation education index). The results for the living standards index now has a p-value of 0.104 . Second, we adopt a more conservative approach and calculate the FDR adjusted q-values over all 12 indexes (presented in curly brackets). Results remain statistically significant for the indexes for first-generation education, work/migration, and marriage market. Indexes for living standards and second-generation education now have pvalues of 0.118 and 0.118 , respectively.\n\n### 6.4 Differential mortality\n\nTo explore whether differential mortality might bias our results, we conduct a number of robustness checks. Appendix Table A. 12 presents three sets of analyses, all of which highlight that the school construction results are not impacted by differential mortality. First, in column 1, we use the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) to estimate if there is a relationship between program exposure and mortality. The sample consists of all individuals ever surveyed in any of the five IFLS rounds and administered the migration module (so that we know their district of birth). The IFLS collected five rounds of longitudinal data from 1993 to 2015. We estimate regressions separately for men and women. Effect sizes are small and not statistically significant indicating that exposure to school construction is not correlated with mortality between 1993 and 2015.\n\nSecond, in column 2, we use the SUSENAS data used in the main tables to re-estimate the first-generation years of schooling regression but now including a control variable meant to capture demographic population changes over time. To construct this control variable, we use the 2016 SUSENAS and the 1995 SUPAS surveys (used in Duflo, 2001) and calculate the ratio of population in 2016 divided by population in 1995 for each district and cohort. This allows us to capture location by cohort variation in demographics and control for this factor in the main",
      "24": "regressions. ${ }^{64}$ Results in column 2 that include a control for the parents' population ratio (covering the 1957-1962 and 1968-1972 cohorts) are unchanged from the main results in Table 1 for years of schooling.\n\nThird, we re-estimate the second-generation years of schooling regression and include these population controls. Column 3 includes the parents' population ratio. Column 4 includes the children's population ratio (covering the cohorts 1981-1995), while column 5 includes the parents and children's population ratios. Results are consistent with the main analysis in Table 5 showing that mother's program exposure is correlated with additional second-generation improvements in years of schooling.\n\n# 6.5 Alternative specifications \n\nIn the main results, we follow Duflo (2001) by using a conservative definition of school exposure. Individuals in the young cohort (born 1968-1972) benefit from full exposure to the program, while those in the old cohort (born 1957-1962) did not benefit from school construction at all. However, there are other birth cohorts, partly exposed and not exposed, that could be included in the analysis. Appendix Table A. 13 examines how the regression for first-generation years of schooling in Table 1 changes with alternative birth cohort definitions. Column 1 repeats the original results and columns 2-5 add additional birth cohorts. In column 2, we add older cohorts born between 1951 and 1956 who were not exposed to school construction. Column 3 adds individuals born between 1963 and 1967 who would have been primary school aged in 1974 (ages 7-11) when the schools were built. To be conservative, we assume none of these cohorts was exposed, although in Appendix Figure A.2a and A.2b, it appears children ages 7-8 probably did benefit from the program. Column 4 includes children born between 1973 and 1980. They were born during and just after the schools were built, and so they would have received full exposure to the program. ${ }^{65}$ Finally, in column 5, we include all individuals born between 1951 and 1980. Results using the different sample definitions are consistent, showing that exposure to school construction increased years of schooling for men and women. In Appendix Figure A.7, we use the extended cohort definition (all individuals born between 1951 and 1980) and re-estimate the effect of school construction on indexes for families of outcomes (as in Figure 1). Results are consistent, showing large positive benefits for men and women exposed to school construction.\n\nFinally, we re-estimate the results measuring the effect of school construction on outcome indexes (as in Figure 1) using alternative control variables. Appendix Figure A. 8 shows results excluding the interaction of birth year dummies and water and sanitation programs. The magnitudes and levels of statistical significance are consistent in this case.\n\n## 7. Rate of Return and Fiscal Impacts of School Construction\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{64}$ We acknowledge that this control variable does not perfectly capture mortality, as the surveys might not be nationally representative at the district by cohort level. However, this measure of changes in population size is likely the best we can construct given the data limitations. Other surveys that have full birth histories, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys, do not contain each individual's birth district and so we would not be able to correctly assign someone's program exposure. Likewise, multiple rounds of census data could be used to generate mortality estimates, but only the 2010 census has birth district information, while the 1980, 1990, and 2000 census rounds lack that information.\n    ${ }^{65}$ These Indonesian primary schools were initially expected to last for 20 years so the last cohort that could have gained the full six years of primary school education and completed primary schooling by 1993 would have been born in 1980. Note that with these 1973-1980 cohorts, parents could potentially have moved to give their children access to these schools, although results are consistent with the earlier ones.",
      "25": "Regression results highlight the various beneficial impacts for individuals exposed to school construction and for the intergenerational transmission of those benefits. We conduct a costbenefit analysis to evaluate whether school construction was cost efficient for the Indonesian government. ${ }^{66}$ Most analyses compare a program's costs and overall welfare benefits of that program for the affected population. We do this as well, but what is unique in our case is our ability also to use detailed data on tax revenues collected by the government to measure if these increases in government taxes collected offset the government's costs of building the schools.\n\nTotal school construction costs include the initial investment to build the schools and train the teachers plus recurring commitments to pay teacher salaries each year. The key point for the costs is that there were large and upfront costs at the beginning of the program in 1973 and then subsequent smaller, but annual costs every year for teacher salaries. Appendix C discusses the specific details about school construction costs.\n\nWe focus on two main benefits. The first is taxes paid directly to the government. We have data on taxes each household paid and information on household expenditures that we use to estimate the 10 percent Value-Added-Tax (VAT) the government would have collected on those purchases. The second benefit is improvements in overall living standards. ${ }^{67}$ The key issue for the benefits is that the government or individual earns the benefits each year and they accrue over many years, but these benefits do not start until long after the schools are built.\n\nWe develop a cost-benefit model to include these costs and benefits in the specific years they would have been realized and then trace out the arc of when discounted benefits and costs offset. Table 6 summarizes results and highlights how different assumptions about parameters influence the level of costs and benefits, impact the year when benefits outweigh costs, and affect the internal rate of return (IRR). Column 1 is a less conservative approach (details discussed in Appendix C). Using these parameters yields a total cost (school building, teacher training, and recurrent teacher salaries) of 2.44 billion in 2016 USD and a total tax benefit (direct taxes paid plus VAT taxes collected) of 5.25 billion in 2016 USD. This gives a net benefit of $\\$ 2.81$ billion, a 2003 breakeven year, and an IRR of 8.1 percent. Moving beyond government taxes and focusing on the program's impact on improving living standards raises net benefits to $\\$ 35.72$ billion with an IRR of 17.9 percent.\n\nAppendix C details how we modify parameters (in columns 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8) from this baseline case and traces how those changes impact costs and benefits. Column 5 represents what we believe is a reasonable baseline case. We maintain previous parameter values but increase the mean number of students per school from 120 to 180 ( 30 per grade), which is closer to what happened when these schools were built. Tax benefits are higher than costs with an IRR of 6.2 percent, while living standards are substantially larger than costs with an IRR of 14.5 percent. In our most conservative calculation, column 9 incorporates intergenerational benefits-when the second generation starts paying taxes and having their own household expenses. Tax and living standards benefits are substantially larger and outweigh costs. ${ }^{68}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{66}$ Appendix C discusses in more detail the assumptions made in our cost-benefit analysis and the specific parameters we include in the model.\n    ${ }^{67}$ Since second-generation individuals receive more education due to school construction, this could lead to further increases in future taxes and improved living standards. We do not include these second-generation effects in most of our cost-benefit analysis, so our estimates are conservative. Results in Table 6 column 9 discussed below incorporate these second-generation effects and benefits are significantly larger.\n    ${ }^{68}$ To have a situation in which tax benefits do not outweigh costs using the column 9 parameters, it is necessary to adjust parameters so that recurrent costs must be greater than 4.3 , the number of students must be less than 68 , or the",
      "26": "Appendix Figure A. 9 graphs the discounted net tax and living standards benefits over time and highlights the breakeven years for when benefits outweigh school construction costs. Using the parameters from columns 5 and 9 in Table 6, we show two highly realistic scenarios that the government would have faced. Net tax benefits are considerably higher in Scenario 9 when we include intergenerational benefits ( $\\$ 18.23$ billion compared to $\\$ 5.40$ billion), but the breakeven year in that scenario is later because that scenario includes higher recurrent costs, a later starting age for paying taxes, and a longer school lifetime. The net benefit to improved living standards is also much higher when the next generation's benefits are included ( $\\$ 136.42$ billion) and the improvement to the population's welfare offsets the program costs by 2002.\n\nAcross a range of different parameter estimates, school construction leads to increased government tax revenues that by themselves offset school construction costs within 51 years. We observe even larger net benefits when we include the population's improved living standards with net benefits ranging from 23 USD to 130 billion USD. Internal rates of return range from 13-18 percent and benefits outweigh costs within 17-28 years after the schools are built.\n\n# 8. Conclusion \n\nThis paper studies the long-term and intergenerational effects of one of the largest school construction programs in history. We use a difference-in-differences estimation strategy exploiting variation across birth cohorts and districts in the number of schools built. We combine this with nationally representative data from Indonesia that contain information on a wide range of outcomes related to education, employment, migration, living standards, taxes, and marriage outcomes. We find that men and women exposed to the program attain more education, with men's education effects continuing beyond primary school. As adults, men exposed to school construction are more likely to be formal workers and work in a non-agricultural sector. Both men and women exposed to the program are more likely to have migrated from their birth district, although evidence points to increases in local migration within the province. Households with women exposed to school construction have higher living standards, more assets, and pay more government taxes. Exposure to school construction substantially alters marriage market outcomes with spouses completing more years of school, being more likely to complete primary education, and more likely to be literate. Improvements in household outcomes are due to mother's, rather than father's, program exposure.\n\nThese benefits are transmitted to the next generation. Children with mothers who are exposed to the school construction program obtain more education. We observe significant effects at all levels of schooling beyond primary school, but we see the largest impacts in tertiary education with effect sizes indicating a 13 percent increase in the likelihood of the secondgeneration child completing university. Father's exposure to the school construction program has no impact on their children's education.\n\nOur cost benefit analysis highlights that under most reasonable assumptions school construction pays for itself in terms of additional expected government tax revenues, not to mention the additional benefits of improved living standards. Furthermore, given the observed intergenerational transmission of education, the likely long-run benefits are vast. To gain additional insight into the intergenerational transmission of education, we perform an exploratory analysis calculating the intergenerational elasticity (IGE) of education between children and parents. In policy circles, especially in developing countries, there is considerable debate about the optimal amount of intergenerational mobility. High mobility suggests equality of opportunity\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    discount rate must be larger than 7.5 percent. However, still net living standards benefits remain positive until the following more drastic parameter adjustment of increasing the discount rate to larger than 13.8 percent is made.",
      "27": "whereby a parent's outcome does not mechanically determine the child's, but it is critical to understand the mechanisms driving that intergenerational correlation (see Black and Devereux, 2011 and Mazumder, 2015 for a discussion of this literature). Low mobility that is due to differential access to schooling suggests that public policy can play a role in equalizing opportunities. Comparing the IGE across high and low program intensity areas and between young and old cohorts in our Indonesian data, we find there is an increase in mobility for children whose mothers are exposed to school construction, highlighting the realized benefits of this government education policy. The broader societal impacts and changes in intergenerational transmission of human capital warrant further research.\n\n# References \n\nAjayi, Kehinde F. and Phillip H.

Effect of school construction on indexes of long-run outcomes\nNotes: Following Kling, Liebman, and Katz (2007), we define indexes for families of outcomes by defining a Z-score for each outcome relative to the control group (defined in this case as the old cohort in low program intensity districts). Then, we average the Z-scores across all outcomes in the same family to get an index, such as \"Marriage Market\". Following Banerjee et al. (2015) to get standardized treatment effects, we then standardize the Kling indexes relative to the mean and standard deviation of the control group. Each dot in the figure represents the coefficient of the interaction of the number of INPRES schools built between 1973 and 1979 in one's birth district and a dummy for being born between 1968 and 1972. Solid lines represent $90 \\%$ confidence intervals. The individual outcomes making up the index for each family are listed in Tables 1-5 and Appendix Table A.1.",

Effect of placebo program exposure are the regression coefficients of father or mother's old cohort dummy interacted with the number of schools constructed in father's or mother's district of birth. All regressions control for father's and mother's district of birth and cohort of birth fixed effects, as well as child age fixed effects and child direct exposure. We also control for children's population, enrollment in 1971, and water and sanitation program intensities that vary by father's and mother's district of birth interacted with father and mother birth year dummies. The survey restricts questions on educational attainment to individuals aged 5 and older. Robust standard errors calculated using multi-way clustering at the father and mother's district of birth are shown in parentheses. Stars denote statistical significance at 1,5 , and $10 \\%$ levels based on unadjusted p -values.

      "74": "# B. Data Appendix \n\nTwo critical data issues about the SUSENAS 2016 survey are relevant for our analysis. First, to estimate the difference-in-differences specification described in Section 3.1, it is necessary to have information about an individual's residence at birth. Current residence could be endogenous to the school construction program as households might move to provide access to schools to their children. Location of birth and location where the individual obtains their education are highly correlated. ${ }^{69}$ However, birth location is not endogenous with respect to the school construction since all of the individuals in the analysis were born before the program started. Given the importance of knowing where the individual was born, it is unfortunate that most household surveys in Indonesia only provide information about the individual's current location of residence. This lack of information about an individual's birth location is the case for the Indonesian Labor Force Survey (Sakernas), the Indonesian Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), and many other rounds of the SUSENAS data, making them unavailable to use to analyze the impacts of the school construction program. However, the SUSENAS 2016 is one exception to this, as there is information on every individual's district of birth.\n\nSecond, it is important that the data include a sufficiently large sample of individuals from these specific birth cohorts (1957-1962 and 1968-1972). The Indonesia Family Life Survey (IFLS) does contain information on each individual's district of residence at birth, thus satisfying the first criterion we outline above. We use the IFLS data to estimate our main difference-indifferences specification exploiting variation across birth cohorts and districts in the number of schools built. The IFLS is a longitudinal survey, and the first round was collected in 1993/1994. Subsequent rounds were collected in 1997, 2000, 2007/2008, and most recently in 2014/2015. Tracking across rounds has been extremely successful, with rates between 92 to 95 percent for each IFLS round (Thomas et. al., 2012). Almost 88 percent of households in survey round one were subsequently interviewed in all of the five survey rounds. In columns 1-3 of Appendix Table B. 1 and B.2, we use the most recent survey round collected in 2014/2015 (IFLS 5) and include all individuals interviewed in that round in the regressions. In columns 4-6 of these tables, we begin with the IFLS 5 and then add in any other individuals from the other four rounds who might no longer be present in the final round of the panel survey. We estimate regressions with different control variables to see if that has any influence on the results. Appendix Table B. 1 examines years of schooling as the dependent variable, while Appendix Table B. 2 examines completed primary. Column 3 (IFLS 5 only) and column 6 (IFLS 5 plus last observed round) in each table correspond with our main results for men and women in Table 1 column 1 (years of schooling) and column 2 (completed primary). We do not observe any statistically significant relationship for men or women between exposure to school construction and increased years of schooling. Similarly, when examining whether women exposed to school construction completed primary school, we do not observe any statistically significant relationship. However, for men, that relationship is negative, indicating school construction exposure lowers the likelihood of completing primary school, and depending on the control variables included in some cases it is statistically significant.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{69}$ Based on the IFLS data, almost 92 percent of children at age 12 still live in the same district where they were born (Duflo, 2001). Likewise, in the SUSENAS 2016, 92.8 percent of children at age 12 live in the same district where they were born.",
      "75": "The IFLS and SUSENAS data have two key differences that might be relevant to explain this situation. First, the SUSENAS data are nationally representative, covering all 34 provinces and all 511 districts in the country. IFLS is representative of only $83 \\%$ of the Indonesian population and covers individuals living in 13 of 27 provinces in the country. Appendix Figure B. 1 shows a map of Indonesian districts with the districts shaded in gray indicating which ones the IFLS survey covers. Comparing Appendix Figure A. 1 (map of Indonesia indicating the spatial distribution of school constructed per 1,000 children) and Appendix Figure B. 1 highlights that many of the districts that had large numbers of schools constructed are not included in the IFLS survey. In column 7 of Appendix Tables B. 1 and B.2, we present results using the SUSENAS 2016 data but restricting the analysis to only those districts covered in the IFLS survey. The coefficients from the regression with this restricted sample with years of schooling as the dependent variable are somewhat smaller ( 0.194 for men and 0.159 for women) compared to the full sample from Table 1, column 1 ( 0.268 for men and 0.234 for women), but the results are still statistically significant and economically meaningful. Likewise, the regressions in column 7 of Appendix Table B. 1 using completed primary as the dependent variable also show smaller effect sizes compared to the full sample. This is evidence that the different geographic coverage of the IFLS and the SUSENAS is unlikely to explain the lack of relationship between school construction and years of schooling in the IFLS data (columns 1-6). Second, note that the number of observations in the IFLS regressions for women is only 2,473 if using only IFLS 5 or 2,659 if using IFLS 5 plus the last observed round for any individual. ${ }^{70}$ This compares with 71,423 observations for women in the regression using the SUSENAS data.

      "79": "# C. Rate of Return and Fiscal Impacts of School Construction Appendix \n\nThis appendix highlights the specific details regarding how we conducted the cost-benefit analysis to measure the fiscal impacts of school construction. School construction cost approximately 782 million 2016 US dollars, around 1.5 percent of the 1973 Indonesian GDP (Duflo, 2001). Schools were expected to recruit three teachers and accommodate 120 students. Using estimates by Daroesman (1971), training three teachers across 61,800 schools would have cost the government 11.7 million in 2016 dollars. ${ }^{71}$\n\nBenefits include both taxes paid directly to the government (household-level taxes as well as estimates for value-added-taxes the government would have collected on household purchases) and improvements in overall living standards. ${ }^{72}$\n\nTable 6 summarizes the cost-benefit results highlighting different assumptions about how parameters influence the costs and benefits. Column 1 is the least conservative approach. For this column, we assume a 5 percent discount rate, no real growth in teachers' salary, no adjustment for the lifetime curvature of an individual's earnings (and subsequent taxes), no real growth in GDP per capita, 120 students per classroom, schools last 20 years, individuals start paying taxes after age 18, school administration costs 1.25 times teachers' salaries, 3 teachers per school, and an individual's life expectancy is 60 .\n\nColumn 2 includes real salary growth for teachers and costs are higher and net benefits smaller. Column 3 adjusts for the lifetime curvature in an individual's tax payments that peak around ages 40-50. Tax and living standards benefits are smaller. Column 4 adjusts for real GDP per capita growth of 3.25 percent. Taxes and living standards are measured in 2016, but those had real growth prior to 2016 and this adjustment reduces net benefits. Column 5 represents a realistic baseline case, and we discuss it in the main text.\n\nColumn 6 assumes schools last 40 years. Original government plans called for schools to last 20 years, but since most schools still operate now, this is a reasonable assumption. Benefits increase as there are more cohorts exposed to the program, but there are more years to pay teacher salaries so costs also increase. Net benefits are higher, but the IRR only rises slightly because of the timing of when extra costs are incurred. Column 7 increases the age individuals start paying taxes; column 8 raises the recurrent cost multiplier from 1.25 to 1.5 . Both changes have minor impacts on net benefits. Column 9 incorporates intergenerational benefits-when the second generation starts paying taxes and having their own household expenditures. This is our most conservative approach, and we discuss the implications in the main text.\n\nFor each of the specific parameters in the table, we define below how those measures are calculated.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{71}$ On the cost side, we adjust various parameters in our model to see how the cost-benefit calculations respond. These parameters include the discount rate, the number of years the school is expected to last, the number of teachers and students per school, whether there is real growth in a teacher's salary, and the level of recurrent school administrative costs in addition to teachers' salaries.\n    ${ }^{72}$ On the benefit side, we adjust various parameters to test the sensitivity of our results. These include the discount rate, the number of years the school is expected to last, the age individuals start paying taxes, an individual's life expectancy, the Indonesian economy's growth rate, and the lifetime curvature in mean taxes paid at each age.",
      "80": "# Discount rate \n\nWorld Development Indicators collects real interest rates in Indonesia between 1987 and 2017. It averages 5.77 percent per year. Since it does not extend as far as our sample period in 1973, we assume a constant annual discount rate of 5 percent.\n\n## Teachers' salary growth\n\nWe first assume there is no real salary growth over the years and use Duflo's (2001) reported teacher's salary in 1973. Subsequently, we allow for linear growth using teacher's salary observations in 1970 by Daroesman (1972), 1973 by Duflo (2001), Intercensal Surveys 1976 and 1995, and Labor Force Surveys 2000, 2005 and 2010. ${ }^{73}$ Teachers are paid for the lifetime of the schools.\n\n## Lifetime curvature\n\nIndividuals' tax payments and living standards generally follow an inverted-U shape, where they peak at around age 40-50. In our SUSENAS data, we observe individuals at their peak. To model the lifetime curvature of tax payments and living standards, we assume the same average effect on taxes and living standards across ages but different means at different ages. An average household with a 20-year old father, for instance, only spends $\\$ 2,373$ annually, compared to the mean in households with a 50-year old father, $\\$ 3,597$.\n\n## GDP/capita growth\n\nGDP per-capita growth is obtained from the World Bank's World Development Indicators. We took the average between 1961 and 2017: 3.25 percent per year.\n\nNumber of students, teachers per school, and recurrent costs/salaries multiplier\nWe follow Duflo (2001) in assuming 120 students/school, 3 teachers/school, and $25 \\%$ recurrent administrative costs in addition to teachers' salaries. These imply a class size of 20 students across six grades of primary education and one teacher per grade. The latter is reasonable given that schools often run two sessions per day: morning and afternoon classes.\n\n## School lifetime\n\nDaroesman (1971) and Duflo (2001) report that schools were expected to last for 20 years. We first use this assumption. We subsequently relax this assumption to 40 years because many INPRES schools are still in-use as of 2016.\n\nIndividuals start paying taxes after age 18\nWe first assume that individuals start paying taxes after finishing upper secondary education at age 18. We subsequently relax this assumption to age 22, after individuals finish Tertiary education.\n\n## Life expectancy\n\nWorld Development Indicators suggest an average of 56.6 years of life expectancy at birth for individuals born between 1968 and 1980. Conditional on making it to primary school age, the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{73}$ We drop Duflo's (2001) reported salary in 1995 because it implies a 9 percent real growth per year and it is much higher than the linear fit would have predicted.

      "81": "life expectancy is likely higher. We assume a life expectancy of 60 years throughout and then relax this assumption in the final column.\n\n# Share of men and women in affected cohorts \n\nWe construct a weighted average of the treatment effects on men and women. The share of women in the affected cohort is 0.498 . For simplicity, we assume an equal share of men and women.\n\n## Intergenerational benefits\n\nWhile we do not directly observe living standard and tax effects on the second generation, we do observe the education benefits on the second generation. We scale the second generation's living standard benefits by the relative ratio of second generation education effect and first generation education effect. We further assume that the first child is born one year after the average age of first marriage (i.e. 25 for fathers and 21 for mothers). Since the average household size in the sample is 4.09 , we assume two children per household and that the second child is born 3 years after the first child."

      "5": "# 1. Introduction \n\nThis study examines the contribution of human capital to economic growth in Guatemala over the past 50 years. ${ }^{2}$ The interest is twofold. First, for the country itself there are very few studies that thoroughly analyze past growth patterns, and there are no studies that empirically appraise the direct impact of education on growth. In general, evidence on human capital and growth comes almost entirely from crosscountry analysis. Single-country studies, however, may be more illuminating since they overcome the heterogeneity problem and take into account the unique historical information for each country. Indeed, the original motivation of studying economic growth focuses on the time-series dynamics of macroeconomic variables. Moreover, the cross-section focus may be inadequate if returns to education or the quality of education differ substantially across countries.\n\nSecond, this study focuses on the contribution of different levels of education to growth. This is an important aspect regarding the problems associated with measuring average years of schooling. Looking at education in a disaggregated way also proves more fruitful to the policy-maker since it indicates how resources should be divided between different education levels. Finally, the empirical analysis is based on an error-correction methodology, deals with endogeneity, and explores several data construction and robustness issues. All this may be relevant for future case studies as well.\n\nThis study, probably for the first time, constructs a reliable data set that accounts for the determinants of long-run growth in Guatemala. In terms of data availability, the country constitutes a most precarious case. Despite these caveats, however, satisfactory and coherent time series data were obtained. The results based on a production function augmented for human capital reveal that a better-educated labor force has a significant positive impact on long-run growth. Consistent with crosscountry evidence, primary and secondary education appear to be most important for productivity growth, followed by tertiary schooling. These findings are in agreement with the micro evidence for Guatemala. Interestingly, the results also suggest that the effect of education in both micro and macro regressions is of similar magnitude.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    2 This paper was originally prepared as a background study for Guatemala's 2005 Country Economic Memorandum. I have benefited from discussions with Eduardo Somensatto, Felipe Jaramillo and Andy Mason (World Bank), Hermann Sautter, Stephan Klasen, Dierk Herzer, Michael Grimm and Julian Weisbrod (University of Goettingen) as well as Armando Morales (IMF) and Juan Alberto Fuentes (UNDP).

I particularly want to thank Silvia Villatoro and Estuardo Morán (Banco de Guatemala) for their great assistance in compiling part of the data.

      "6": "This holds while changing the conditioning set of the variables, for example by considering trade openness. An interesting result is that primary schooling seems to be particularly affected by policies that promote competitiveness. This does not suggest, however, that other schooling levels are unimportant. Rather it seems that in Guatemala, during the past decades, a sufficient coverage and quality of primary education were the minimum requirement to adopt foreign technologies. Overall, the econometric results have been found robust, even after controlling for endogeneity as well as for alternative data sources.\n\nFinally, a modified growth-accounting framework is presented which takes into account quality changes of physical capital and differentiates by the level of education. It shows that the human capital variables explain more than 50 percent of output growth. Of these, secondary schooling was the main determinant of growth. Due to an environment of social and political conflict, however, productivity growth was slightly negative over the past decades. In addition, given the increase of average education and a decay of the quality-adjusted physical capital at the same time, there is evidence of a missing complementarity between the country's skills and its technology base. Ultimately, the empirical findings point towards the importance of an institutional and political environment conducive to growth.\n\nThis study is organized into eight sections. The following section briefly assesses patterns of growth and some of the reasons that led to a low endowment of human capital. Section 3 discusses how to measure the contribution of human capital to growth over time. Furthermore, it provides an overview of relevant empirical findings. Section 4 is concerned with data compilation. Section 5 introduces the empirical methodology and presents the main results, disaggregated by education level. Section 6 tests the robustness of the results. The regressions include several variables that help to explain the country's growth performance, for example measures for the quality of capital, trade and governance. Based on these findings, section 7 accounts for the sources of growth. Section 8 concludes.\n\n# 2. Patterns of Growth in Guatemala \n\nTo understand Guatemala's growth patterns, and hence the role of education, its turbulent political and social history must be taken into account. Average annual growth rates were about 3.9 percent between 1951 and 2002. According to Bailén (2001) this is in line with the neighbor countries. ${ }^{3}$ Due to rapid population growth, however, per capita growth in Guatemala has averaged only about 1.3 percent per\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    3 For example, growth has been lower than in Costa Rica (4.7 percent) but higher than in Honduras ( 3.7 percent), El Salvador ( 3.2 percent) and Nicaragua ( 2.1 percent).",
      "7": "year. A continuation of this growth rate implies that the average Guatemalan would need approximately 53 years to double his real income.\n\nHistorically, growth was not particularly pro-poor, i.e. favoring the rural or agricultural economy where the poor live. The elite domination and ethnic division failed to promote social and institutional development. Instead, growth in Guatemala's was accompanied by the exclusion of large parts of the society from wealth, and, as a consequence, accompanied by underlying social conflict. Poverty rates and inequality indicators are among the highest in the Latin American region. According to the World Bank (2003a) about 56 percent of Guatemala's population lives in poverty in 2000.\n\n# Box 1. Guatemala: Growth with Low Productivity and Poor Social Development \n\nRelatively few studies focus on Guatemala's growth experience over a long time period. One of the most comprehensive assessments is a voluminous study by Gómez and Ordoñez (1991). They focus on structural adjustment issues for the early 1990s, but their conclusions are still of interest. In particular, they claim that productivity in Guatemala was low because of manifold structural problems, including a deficient financial intermediation system and 'resistance' to technological change. That is, Guatemala's international competitiveness was traditionally based on a low-skilled labor force with consequently poor social development and little incentives for firms to increase productivity. In addition, a culture of rent-seeking among entrepreneurs as well as public institutional and financial weakness prevented significant change.\n\nGuatemala's recent growth experience can be divided into three broad episodes. Figure 1 visualizes annual GDP growth from 1951-2003, where selected parallel historical events are given from Luján (2000). ${ }^{4}$ Table 1 presents the average output growth rates of primary, industry and service sectors for the period 1951-2003. In addition, there are three sub-periods. The growth rates of the primary sectors in Guatemala, which employ the majority of the rural and poor people, lagged behind other sectors for the entire time period. By contrast, in particular for the last decades, the growing sectors where those of electricity, communications and banking. Until approximately 1975, Guatemala appears to have had a reasonable growth performance, followed by a remarkable slowdown for the later periods. However, this requires closer examination.\n\nLa 'edad de oro', 1951-1975. During the first period Guatemala maintained reasonable growth rates. Ever since the 1954 coup, military governments were repeatedly in power, sometimes through fraudulent elections, sometimes by coup d'états. In terms of its growth performance, this era is sometimes referred to as the 'golden period' but the denomination is very misleading. This is because the structural imbalances of the economy remained unchanged and ultimately gave rise to the explosion of civil strife. Annual growth was highly volatile? a fact most likely\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    4 The correlations do not necessarily imply causality. Moreover, in many Latin American countries growth rates during the decades of the 1950s and 1960s were quite volatile as well.",

For example, in 1956 a new constitution was drawn up and in 1963 Guatemala was preparing to enter into the Central American Common Market (MCCA). ${ }^{5}$ At first sight, Figure 1 suggests that the civil war's guerilla activities starting around 1960 - appeared to have an impact only on short-run growth. However, the later growth accounting exercise suggests that, indeed, the trend growth of total factor productivity (TFP) was negatively affected by the civil strife from the beginning.\n\nFigure 1.

A second period starts shortly after the deterioration of the terms of trade and the international oil crisis. In 1976 a major earthquake affected Guatemala. After 1977, social tension culminated in a full-scale civil war that reached genocidal proportions in the early 1980s. Consequently, growth declined dramatically. Apart from causing immense human sorrow, these events destroyed human life and physical capital. They also imposed high costs for long-run growth.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    5 An excellent review of the rise and fall of the Central American integration process for 19501999 can be found in de La Ossa (2000).",
      "9": "Recuperation and stagnation, 1985-2002. A third episode of growth begins approximately in 1985 when democracy was restored, albeit with civilian governments patronized by the generals. Although growth rates recovered, they have ever since followed a more or less stagnant pattern. A cornerstone in economic and social development in history was the signing of the Agreement of a 'Firm and Lasting Peace' in December 1996, the formal end to the civil war. Since the signing of the UN-sponsored Peace Accords, Guatemala has made progress by increasing investments in infrastructure and human capital. It has also made some efforts to improve public financial management, and in the area of tax revenues. However, UNDP (2003a) finds that the implementation of the Peace Accords has been uneven. Moreover, in particular during the past decades, Guatemala seems to be affected by electoral cycles. This issue has been investigated by López-Cálix (2002) who indeed finds weak empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis.\n\n# Box 2. Social Conflict and Guatemala's Growth Collapse \n\nA key study for understanding the Guatemalan growth collapse after 1975 is Rodrik (1999). His core idea is that the effect of the external shocks on growth is increased within the context of 'social conflict' and weak institutions for 'conflict management.' The term social conflict refers to the depth of social inequality and ethic fragmentation. Conflict management refers to democratic institutions, an effective judiciary and a non-corrupt bureaucracy. All of these adjudicate distributional competition within a framework of rules and accepted procedures. However, as in the case of Guatemala, the economic costs of shocks can be magnified by the associated distributional conflicts. These are triggered because social divisions run deep and governmental as well as democratic institutions are weak. Consequently, the productivity of resource utilization can be diminished in a number of ways. For example, by delaying adjustments in fiscal policies and key relative prices, including the real exchange rate and real wages. In addition, these adjustments may generate uncertainty in the economic environment and paralyze the economy for years. Cross-country econometric evidence supports this hypothesis. Rodrik finds that countries experiencing the sharpest drops after 1975 were those with divided societies and weak institutions. This seems indeed to be the case for Guatemala, and is an important finding not only in retrospect but also for the future.\n\nFinally, GDP growth has declined continually since 1999. The processes behind this decline are not exactly understood. It is uncertain whether this represents a decrease in Guatemala's trend growth or a prolonged cyclical downturn. However, it is not unreasonable to argue that this decline is partly associated with high levels of violence, kidnappings (including the central bank governor) and social unrest. In addition, Guatemala scores poorly on most governance indicators, particularly those for corruption, the rule of law and the justice system, and political stability. The culmination of these factors ultimately seems to damage the climate for growth and investment. ${ }^{6}$\n\n6 Larrain (2004) analyses these issues in more detail. Hypotheses for the recent growth slowdown can be found in World Bank (2003b). These include restrictive macroeconomic policies, unfavorable external developments, the ending of the economic model relying on traditional agro-exports, and several political factors. As of June 2000, Guatemala is listed as noncooperative country in the OECD-backed 'Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering.'",
      "10": "Somewhat paradoxical, over the past decades, Guatemala has experienced relative macroeconomic stability. Guatemala has a rather low level of external indebtedness, inflation has been held back, and after a process of (uncompleted) structural reforms the economy is now fairly open and with low levels of protection. Thus, contrary to other Latin American countries, macroeconomic mismanagement may presumably not be regarded as the main factor to understand Guatemala's modest performance in terms of per capita growth. Rather, other issues undermine Guatemala's long-run growth patterns. ${ }^{7}$ In addition to the factors already mentioned, one is low human capital endowment.\n\nTable 1.

The World Bank (2003a) and UNDP (2002) document that insufficient cheap labor, in particular for coffee, was the main barrier for the expansion of export crops during earlier periods. Hence, in order to create a low-wage labor force, the campesino and indigenous society was excluded from education. The plantation economy that resulted provided little incentives to accumulate human capital. Historically, the low level of schooling is also an outcome\n\n7 During a very brief episode in the early 1990s, inflation increased and fiscal discipline eroded.

For the attentive observer, these issues are still felt today.\n\nTable 2 shows that the country still performs poorly for indicators of education and health, and ranks highest among states in the region for child malnutrition, despite some improvements over time. ${ }^{8}$ In addition, Guatemala spends less on education than any other country in the region. Based on household survey data comparing the education level of age cohorts, the Inter-American Development Bank (2001) finds that the educational gap between Guatemala and other Latin American countries is widening.\n\nTable 2.

N.D. = no data available.\n\nHistorically, it may be that a certain degree of development and growth in Guatemala was attainable with a skilled elite and a large amount of unskilled workers. Since the economy has diversified over time and is now less dependent on agriculture than before (Segovia and Lardé 2002), the past exclusionary education policies may present an obstacle for future growth. On the micro level, there is evidence suggesting that insufficient human capital constitutes a constraint for production. For\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    8 Anderson (2001) provides a brief synopsis of recent developments in the education sector.",
      "12": "example, a firm survey by Grupo de Servicios de Información (1999) indicates that for all firms the quality of skills ranks as the second most important constraint. For small firms, important for employment and income generation, the quality of skills is the main production constraint.\n\n# 3. Measuring the Contribution of Education to Growth \n\nThe accumulation of human capital through education has long been acknowledged to be an important factor in the development process of a nation. Education is thought to be beneficial because it decreases inequality, improves the quality of life, and in particular it is a factor in rising the income level and facilitating economic growth. This section will concentrate on the latter effect and summarize some evidence on the relationship between education and growth.\n\n### 3.1 Augmented Solow Model and Endogenous Growth\n\nThe existing literature contains a number of distinct conceptual rationales for the inclusion of human capital in models of economic growth. According to Sianesi and van Reenen (2003), the two main macro approaches are the augmented Solow model and the new growth theories.\n\n## Augmented Solow Model\n\nOne way to estimate the impact of education on growth is to adapt the Solow (1956) model. The augmented version extends the basic framework to allow human capital as an extra input to enter the production function. In particular Mankiw et al. (1992) show that traditional growth theory can accommodate human capital and provide a reasonable approximation for empirical analysis. At the economy-wide level, it may also take into account human capital externalities. Still, one of the key insights is that the factor accumulation affects the level of income, but per se is insufficient to achieve long-run growth. Long-run growth depends rather on growth in technological progress. Human capital accumulation may therefore have only a short-term impact on the rate of growth.\n\nHowever, rates of accumulation are expected to have explanatory power for growth rates during the transition to an eventual equilibrium growth path. In particular, considering the case of Guatemala? presumably far away from a balanced growth process? consideration of transition could open up the possibility of assessing the macroeconomic role of education for economic growth within this framework. In addition, since the 'short run' in the context of growth theory is often thought of in terms of decades, these effects can be worthwhile policy objectives. Up to now, for the reasons clarified below, this approach has remained the workhorse of applied empirical research. The model is fairly flexible and allows for alternative specifications that can be adjusted to best match the available data.",
      "13": "# Endogenous Growth Approach \n\nExpanding these ideas, new growth theories emphasize the endogenous determination of technological progress, which is determined within the model. Thus, long-run growth can be affected by government policies instead of being driven by exogenous technological change. With respect to human capital, the endogenous growth approach argues that there should be an additional effect over and above the static effect on the level of output. Models that explain long-run growth by focusing on technological progress and research and development, such as Romer (1990a) and Grossman and Helpman (1991), argue that domestic technological progress results from the search for innovations. The discovery of an innovation, undertaken by profit-maximizing individuals, raises productivity and is ultimately the source of long-run growth. This kind of model attributes growth to the existing stock of human capital. A second category is the model of Lucas (1988). It broadens the concept of capital and suggests that human capital accumulation may be an engine of growth itself, due to spillover effects that negate diminishing returns in production.\n\nIn particular, with respect to developing countries, one way of characterizing the role of human capital is the consideration of technology transfer from innovating countries. Already Nelson and Phelps (1966) suggested that education facilitates the adoption and implementation of new technologies, which are continuously invented. For example, countries with lagging technological capacity may be most able to catch-up if they have a large stock of human capital. In this case, the level of human capital effects growth by facilitating improvements in productivity. Also Lucas (1990) conjectures that physical capital does not flow from rich to poor countries because of a relatively low stock of complementary human capital.\n\nIn a rather influential study, Benhabib and Spiegel (1994) propose an empirical growth model in which human capital externalities can be considered in subsequent advances in education and in new physical capital via technology import. Their results indeed suggest that human capital impacts growth through two mechanisms. On the one side, human capital seems to influence the rate of domestically produced innovation, as proposed in the endogenous growth model of Romer (1990a). On the other side, in the spirit of Nelson and Phelps (1966), they claim that the human capital stock affects the speed of adoption of technology from abroad. More recently, in a generalized version of their model of technology diffusion? that allows for a nonlinear specification of total factor productivity growth? Benhabib and Spiegel (2003) find that a minimum initial human capital level is necessary to exhibit catchup in productivity relative to the leader nation.\n\nHowever, Pritchett (2001) agues convincingly that the finding of only a level effect on growth is rather puzzling. First, in the framework of endogenous growth, spillover effects of knowledge should be in addition to rather instead of the production effects of human capital. In other words, finding only spillover effects may be inconsistent with the micro evidence on the returns to education. Second, as will be stressed in",
      "14": "more detail in the next section, Jones (1995) criticism of endogenous growth models applies here. That is, growth rates cannot be made a function of non-stationary parameters unless cointegration between the variables is accepted.\n\n# 3.2 Some Implications for Empirical Testing \n\nDistinguishing between the role of education as a factor of production, and as a factor that facilitates technology absorption and the production of knowledge, is significant. Any policy measure which raises the level of human capital may only have a one-and-for-all effect in the first framework, but will increase the growth rate of the economy forever in the second one. In such cases, the estimated increase in productivity is not simply a phenomenon in the transitional period since an increase in the flow of education leads to a gradual increase in human capital stock. Implicit is the claim that by increasing the level of education the rate of economic growth will increase over time. Empirically, however, there is no consensus over which is the appropriate approach.\n\n## Observational Equivalence\n\nA main problem for empirical testing at the macro level emerges from observational equivalence. This means that, despite a number of different ways of hypothesizing how human capital can affect growth, empirical analysis can yield similar predictions regarding the relationship between some human capital variables and some variables of income growth. In other words, apart from data uncertainty, the empirical research seeking to test these alternatives has been hampered by the use of relatively similar econometric specifications. Insofar, macro regressions do not readily allow testing one theory against another. Rather they tend to emphasize an expanded set of variables as suggested by the literature. Consequently, Romer (1990b) argues that the role of an endogenous growth framework is not to generate testable predictions, but rather to guide the process of data analysis.\n\n## The Jones Critique\n\nA second criticism, especially relevant for the present study, is the seminal contribution of Jones (1995). Testing endogenous growth models in the context of time series implies establishing a relationship between a variable that is usually stationary? without drift? such as income growth, and a variable which is usually non-stationary, such as years of schooling. In other words, his results fundamentally call into question the implicit prediction of many endogenous growth models suggesting output growth should exhibit large permanent increases. Time series data over a very long time period for the United States and other OECD countries reveal that the growth rates of GDP per capita in these countries exhibit little persistent changes, and can be characterized by more or less constant mean.\n\nThis observation imposes a testable prediction. According to endogenous growth models permanent changes in certain policy variables, such as schooling, or the number of scientists and engineers engaged in research and development, should have",
      "15": "permanent effects on the rate of economic growth. Empirically, however, neither in the United States nor in other OECD countries does economic growth seem to exhibit such an effect. Incidentally, albeit for different reasons than in the OECD countries, these stationarity properties seem to be equally true for schooling and income growth in the Guatemalan data, as demonstrated in the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests in the Appendix.\n\n# 3.3 More Evidence on Education and Growth \n\nEmpirical studies usually take the form of regression analysis and typically look at many more explanatory variables than human capital. A large number of papers have found one or more variables that correlate with growth. In fact, their number is very large and the question arises which combinations of these variables are actually robust. In the context of the present study, some of these findings will be outlined next.\n\n## Weak Correlations\n\nWhile there is strong theoretical support for a key role of human capital in growth, Sala-i-Martin (2002), Easterly (2001) and in particularly Pritchett (2001) argue that the empirical relationship between education and growth is weak. ${ }^{9}$ However, more specifically, Temple (2001) points out that fragile correlation in cross-country data may be due to measurement error and influential exceptions. Also, some kinds of relationships are more robust that others. For example, what is less clear and weak is the relationship of educational growth rates on output growth, the role of different education levels, and differences in effects of female and male education on growth. By contrast, some measures of health seem to be positively correlated with growth. In addition to human capital, many other factors have been found to be important for growth. Following Barro (2001), these include institutions, such as free markets, secure property rights and the rule of law. Similarly, more open economies and countries with lower initial inequality appear to experience higher growth.\n\n## Conditional Convergence\n\nOne much debated prediction of neoclassical growth models is that of convergence. Poor countries should grow relatively faster than rich countries if countries are similar with respect to their structural parameters for preferences and technology. The cross-country studies by Mankiw et al. (1992), Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) and Barro (2001) find some evidence of convergence, albeit in a modified form. More\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    9 Pritchett (2001) uses measures of the growth rate of human capital and finds a negative impact on output growth. Easterly (2001) argues that human capital accumulation is not a panacea. He emphasizes indirect ways that explain technological progress and factor accumulation by looking at the features of economies that facilitate them, such as government policies and structural issues.",
      "16": "specifically, among other things, convergence is found conditional upon a country's initial human capital stock. Therefore, a poor country on average may grow faster, but only if the poor country's human capital stock is above the amount initially expected at the level of per capita income.\n\n# Reverse Causality \n\nMost of the evidence of some sort of relationship between education and growth is based on statistical correlations. From these correlations, it has been generally inferred that higher levels of education cause higher growth. One critique of these findings comes from Bils and Klenow (2000) who suggest reverse causation. Based on a calibrated micro-foundation model, they claim that faster growth induces people to stay longer in school. In other words, the channel from schooling to growth that is assumed to dominate in many models cannot explain all the observed correlation between education and growth. However, the reverse channel provides some explanation. Therefore, in an econometric framework, schooling should be treated as an endogenous input with respect to income. This implies making use of econometric methods for dealing with this problem.\n\n## Few Individual Case Studies\n\nRecent research has mainly relied on cross-country regression analysis. However, the original motivation of studying economic growth focuses on the time-series dynamics of macroeconomic variables. In addition, the cross-section focus may be inadequate if rates of return to education or the quality of education differ substantially across countries. Unfortunately, with respect to human capital, there are very few studies that analyze a single country over a certain time period.\n\nThe exception is a study from Jenkins (1995) using time series data from 1971-1992 for the United Kingdom. Still, the limited size of her time series sample makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions that can be generalized. Also Pissarides (2000) summarizes single case studies for India, Egypt, Tanzania and Chile. Part of an OECD project, these studies were to provide a more thorough test of the relation between human capital and growth in a single country context. For the case of India, the study less plagued with methodological or data problems, the regressions show a significant contribution of human capital on industrial output growth. The estimate suggests that an increase in the average number of years of schooling by 1 year should raise output by about 30 percent.\n\n## Magnitude of the Education Effect\n\nIn the augmented Solow model, the role of education can be inferred from estimates of the regression coefficients. However, with reference to the empirical research reviewed in Sianesi and van Reenen (2003), there is no agreement on its magnitude. In principle, there would be positive empirical evidence in favor of a macroeconomic productivity effect of education if the elasticity of human capital resembles the share",
      "17": "of human capital in factor income. As a measure of reference, one can calculate the share of human capital in labor income from back-of-the-envelope calculations.\n\nFor example, Mankiw et al. (1992) consider the minimum wage as the return to labor with no education. Historically, the minimum wage has been between 30 to 50 percent of average wage income in the United States. On this account, it would follow that the return to education equals about 50 to 70 percent in labor income, which is about 70 percent of total factor income. Obviously, the problem with this kind of calculation is that in developing countries the minimum wage is less enforced and less likely applicable. ${ }^{10}$ Pritchett (2001) therefore uses an estimation based on the distribution of wages. Either of these calculations suggest that the human capital coefficient should be at least $1 / 3$.\n\n# Effects of Education Levels \n\nSomewhat surprisingly, relatively few studies at the macro level address the question of level-specific education effects. The view that schooling does not have the same impact on economic growth at different education levels is based on the labor economics literature. Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2002) provide a comprehensive review on the rates of return to education. International evidence suggests that returns vary according to the education level. Lower income countries tend to have higher returns to schooling. If education has economic externalities? such as expanding well-being and the technological possibilities of the economy? the true benefits of education may be better captured by the study of different education levels on economic growth. This is because the computation of rates of returns based on micro data can only measure the effects of education through individual's wages. However, this might not hold in macro analysis.\n\nWithin an endogenous growth framework one can also derive a distinct role for each education level. The intuition here is that primary education provides individuals with basic cognitive skills that enhance productivity in the production of final goods, but only post-primary education facilitates the absorption of new technologies, and enables individuals to contribute to the production of knowledge. Empirically, in the framework of the augmented Solow model, treating each education level as a separate input into production can quantify the role of primary, secondary and tertiary schooling. While the standard approach in the literature is to consider an aggregate measure of human capital, there are some exceptions that will be briefly reviewed now.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    10 In Guatemala, the legal minimum wage currently amounts to approximately 3-5 U.S. dollars per day (UNDP 2003a). While the legal minimum wages are relatively high with respect to average wages, about $1 / 2$ of workers in Guatemala earn less than the legal minimum wage. This is because of weak enforcement and the fact that self-employed workers are not subject to the minimum wage regulation.",
      "18": "Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1995) regress the growth rate of GDP per capita for a large sample of countries on initial income and a set of control variables. Four measures of educational attainment are always present. These are average years of male secondary and higher schooling as well as average years of female secondary and higher schooling. The male education variables have a jointly significant impact on growth. The female variables enter sometimes with a negative sign. One possible interpretation, advocated by Barro, is that females are discriminated in the formal labor markets. Another explanation for this rather 'puzzling' finding could be simply due to collinearity of the education variables. ${ }^{11}$ Other regressions include average years of female and male primary education. None of these variables are found to be significant. Barro (2001) has continued to investigate the relations between education and growth using the same methodology. An important finding here is that school quality is much more important to growth than its quantity. Overall, the studies do not make very clear the effect of education levels on growth given the negative contribution of secondary female schooling, and the insignificant result for primary education.\n\nAnother paper that investigates the link between education levels and growth is Petrakis and Stamatakis (2002). In a cross-country regression with a relatively small sample size they consider three groups of countries: advanced, developed and less developed. The empirical results suggest that the link of education and growth varies with respect to a country's level of development. Primary education is more important in less developed countries, while higher education seems dominant in advanced countries. In fact, there is some similarity with Gemmel (1996) who also distinguishes between primary, secondary and tertiary schooling for these three groups of countries. He argues that the effects of human capital on growth are most apparent at the primary and secondary levels in developing countries, but at the tertiary level for OECD countries. Unfortunately, the findings in both studies do not allow one to assess with certainty the role of secondary education. In fact, it sometimes enters with a negative sign.\n\nFinally, based on a framework similar to Benhabib and Spiegel, Papageorgiou (2003) is also concerned to empirically determine the contribution of primary and postprimary education on growth. In a cross-country regression he finds that primary education contributes mainly to the production of final output, whereas post-primary education contributes to the adoption and innovation of technology. When the data is divided into subsamples, the results are less encouraging. However, the implicit claim\n\n11 Klasen (2002) argues that the education variables are generally correlated. Empirically, this makes it difficult to identify individual effects of female and male education. However, the negative effect for female secondary education disappears once regional dummy variables are incorporated into econometric models. This finding may be due to East Asia's large initial gender gaps in the 1960s, and the combination of low economic growth and comparatively lower gender gaps in Latin America.",
      "19": "is that for the poorest countries human capital acts mainly as input into final production and, to a lesser extent, as a facilitator for innovation. The relative contribution of human capital to innovation seems to increase with country wealth. Overall this is an interesting study. Nevertheless, the analysis ignores the Jones (1995) critique, and the conclusions are ultimately derived from a priori assumptions.\n\n# 3.4 Summing-Up \n\nEmpirical results often do not allow for a clear-cut measurement of the macroeconomic role of education on growth, and theory seems to be much ahead of empirics. Cross-country evidence suggests that the relative importance of education level varies by the degree of a country's development. Results that come close to a priori expectation of the magnitude of human capital on growth seem to share three properties. First, a specification of the underlying regression that is based on a production function. Second, in particular regarding human capital, empirical data of reasonable quality. And finally, a functional form of the regression equation that tends to reduce econometric problems.\n\nAttempts to measure empirically the impact of education on growth can be divided into two broad categories. The augmented Solow model originates the first class, while the second group is inspired by an endogenous growth approach. However, this is rather a conceptual framework for thinking about growth, which can be useful in the analysis of data, but does not generate a set of easily testable equations nor sharp quantitative predictions. In the light of observational equivalence and given the problems associated with testing endogenous growth models in a time series context, the following analysis will be based on a production function augmented for human capital. Nevertheless, some attention will be given to variables that proxy for trade openness and technological innovation, and their joint impact on education.\n\n## 4. Data Compilation in a Post-Conflict Country\n\nGuatemala is definitely deficient in easily accessible data. Thus, to identify the macroeconomic impact of education on economic growth, a primary task is to overcome information constraints. It is important to note that a significant fraction of the economic activity in Guatemala can be found in the informal sectors. Since this lack of documentation does not influence all factors equally, there remains a potential bias that cannot always be traced.\n\nHowever, satisfactory and coherent results can be obtained. A sizable amount of information, although not easily accessible, can be compiled from disperse or bulky individual files. Even for local experts, this is a challenging task. The lack of a consistent compilation of data to allow a serious analysis of growth patterns hampers inter-temporal comparisons and, more generally, research of development patterns for",
      "20": "the country. Given these constraints, so far, there is very limited empirical research on virtually any macroeconomic topic in Guatemala.\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the data needed for the analysis that follows. These are measures for the human and physical capital stock and the labor force, and quality indices for human and physical capital. Information other than that reported in this section is listed in the Appendix. The time series are mainly from Banco de Guatemala, and, in the case of educational statistics, from the Ministry of Education and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.\n\n# 4.1 Human Capital Stock \n\nThe human capital stock of Guatemala is defined by average years of schooling evident in the labor force. ${ }^{12}$ In line with most empirical analyses, this study assumes that years of schooling provides a reasonable approximation of the human capital stock, although it should be briefly stressed that the indicator is incomplete for several reasons.\n(1) Education as proxy variable. Human capital is multifaceted and includes a complex set of human attributes. As a consequence, the genuine level of human capital is hard to measure in quantitative form. At best, average years of schooling can be regarded as a proxy for the component of the human capital stock obtained in schools. Therefore, in a later robustness test, life expectancy at birth will be included in the regressions. Life expectancy is commonly viewed as a companion indicator to educational capital that captures the effect of health.\n(2) Quality changes. Average years of schooling measurements do not take into account quality changes within the education system. Quality changes may complicate comparison of schooling effects on growth over time as well as making comparisons with other countries difficult. Bratsberg and Terrel (2002), CIEN (2002) and the World Bank (1995c) argue that the quality of the education system in Guatemala is rather low, and may not have shown much improvement over time.\n(3) Aggregation bias. Average years of schooling raise human capital by an equal amount regardless of whether a person is enrolled in a primary, secondary or tertiary school. This is an important point because by defining human capital by average years of schooling, one implicitly gives the same weight to any year of schooling acquired by a person. This completely disregards the findings of the microeconomic literature on wage differentials. For example, Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2002) suggest that the rates of return to education could be decreasing with the acquisition\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    12 The use of labor force instead of total population data is due to problems regarding the Guatemalan population data for the 1980s. By contrast, the labor force proxy used here is assumed to take into account some of the effects of the civil war, i.e. migration and displacement.",
      "21": "of additional schooling. Therefore, in order to capture the impact of education on growth better, a more complete picture will be presented by analyzing the role of primary, secondary and tertiary schooling.\n\nAfter making some modifications to account for the statistical circumstances in Guatemala, the following procedure for constructing estimates of the human capital stock is used, based on the attainment census method advocated by Barro and Lee (2001). The use of a perpetual inventory method that employs census and survey information on educational attainment as benchmark figure can be seen as a major advantage over previous methodologies. The benchmarks are taken from various national censuses and surveys, see Table 3. Guatemalan statistics report distributional attainment stratified by age and sex in five cases: no formal education, first cycle of primary, second cycle of primary, first cycle of secondary, second cycle of primary and tertiary education. The data has been summarized into 4 broad categories, that is, no school, some primary, some secondary and some tertiary education.\n\nThe procedure starts to construct current flows of adult population, which are added to the initial benchmark stocks of the labor force (taken for 1950 from the Barro and Lee 2001 data set). The formulas for the three levels of schooling for the labor force aged 15 and over are as follows:\n\n$$\nH N_{0, t}=H N_{0, t-1} \\cdot\\left(1-\\delta_{t}\\right)+L 15_{t} \\cdot\\left(1-P R I_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\nH N_{1, t}=H N_{1, t-1} \\cdot\\left(1-\\delta_{t}\\right)+L 15_{t} \\cdot\\left(P R I_{t-1}-S E C_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\nH N_{2, t}=H N_{2, t-1} \\cdot\\left(1-\\delta_{t}\\right)+L 15_{t} \\cdot S E C_{t}-L 20_{t} \\cdot T E R_{t}\n$$\n\n$$\nH N_{3, t}=H N_{3, t-1} \\cdot\\left(1-\\delta_{t}\\right)+L 20_{t} \\cdot T E R_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nH N_{j}= & \\text { number of the economically active population for whom } \\mathrm{j} \\text { is the highest } \\\\\n& \\text { level of schooling attained }(\\mathrm{j}=0 \\text { for no school, } \\mathrm{j}=1 \\text { for primary, } \\mathrm{j}=2 \\text { for } \\\\\n& \\text { secondary and } \\mathrm{j}=3 \\text { for higher education }) \\\\\nP R I= & \\text { enrollment ratio for primary education } \\\\\nS E C= & \\text { enrollment ratio for secondary education } \\\\\nT E R= & \\text { enrollment ratio for tertiary education } \\\\\nL= & \\text { number of the economically active population } \\\\\nL 15= & \\text { number of persons aged } 15 \\\\\nL 20= & \\text { number of persons aged } 20\n\\end{aligned}\n$$",

The term $L_{t}-L 15_{t}$ describes the number of survivals from the previous period, which are subtracted from $L_{t-1}$ in order to estimate the total number of missing persons. Equation (5) as such describes the proportion of the labor force which did not survive from the previous period. The formulas can be rearranged to create the final equations that were used to generate the attainment ratios, $h r_{j}$, for the four broad levels of schooling for the economically active population aged 15 and over:\n\n$$\nh r_{0, t}=\\frac{H N_{0, t}}{L_{t}}=h r_{0, t-1} \\cdot\\left(1-\\frac{L 15_{t}}{L_{t}}\\right)+\\frac{L 15_{t}}{L_{t}} \\cdot\\left(1-P R I_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\nh r_{1, t}=\\frac{H N_{1, t}}{L_{t}}=h r_{1, t-1} \\cdot\\left(1-\\frac{L 15_{t}}{L_{t}}\\right)+\\frac{L 15_{t}}{L_{t}} \\cdot\\left(P R I_{t-1}-S E C_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\n$$\nh r_{2, t}=\\frac{H N_{2, t}}{L_{t}}=h r_{2, t-1} \\cdot\\left(1-\\frac{L 15_{t}}{L_{t}}\\right)+\\frac{L 15_{t}}{L_{t}} \\cdot S E C_{t}-\\frac{L 20_{t}}{L_{t}} \\cdot T E R_{t}\n$$\n\n$$\nh r_{3, t}=\\frac{H N_{3, t}}{L_{t}}=h r_{3, t-1} \\cdot\\left(1-\\frac{L 15_{t}}{L_{t}}\\right)+\\frac{L 20_{t}}{L_{t}} \\cdot T E R_{t}\n$$\n\nThe procedure requires school enrollment ratios that are crucial for exact calculations, but the proper accounting for Guatemala is not easy. Even though net enrollment ratios would be more precise for estimating the accumulation of human capital, gross enrollment ratios are used, as only this data is available. As reported in the Appendix, the ratios are taken from various yearbooks of the Guatemalan Ministry of Education (MINEDUC) for the 1990s, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for earlier periods, and other sources available for Guatemala. The data for primary, secondary and tertiary enrollment ratios have been found consistent over time. Interpolation techniques were used to fill gaps in the data, but the use of this approach was kept to a minimum. The tertiary enrollment time series were more difficult to compile and required greater use of interpolated estimates.",
      "23": "In general, the estimated attainment data compares favorably with the census and survey information. The less accurate fit for 1981 is here believed to be due to large measurement errors or the possible manipulation of the census, which took place during the peak of the armed conflict in Guatemala. Consequently, this discrepancy was not smoothed over. Equally, data for 1998 differs slightly from the estimate. This is due to the fact that the survey largely oversamples the urban population of the economy in that year. Given the simplicity of the assumptions of the underlying model, however, the overall results have been found quite satisfactory.\n\nTable 3.

Discrepancies are due to rounding.\n\nIn any case, simply employing gross enrollment ratios would overestimate the accumulation of human capital. Gross enrollment ratios are defined as the ratio of total enrollment in the respective schooling level to the population of the age group that is expected to be enrolled at that level. Thus, gross enrollment ratios can exceed 1 and therefore exaggerate the true amount of enrollment when students repeat, which is often the case in Guatemala. ${ }^{13}$ In response to this problem and in order to benchmark the estimated educational attainment data with census and survey information, the gross enrollment ratios have been adjusted by a depreciation factor for the respective education level, as reported in Loening (2004).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    13 The use of net enrollment ratios is hampered by large data gaps. Also, net enrollment ratios introduce large measurement errors if there are under- or over-aged children starting at each level of education, see Barro and Lee (2001). In Guatemala students who start late constitute a significant fraction of total enrollment—in particular for primary schooling.",
      "24": "Finally, the formula to construct the measure for the human capital stock combines the estimated attainment data with the information on the duration of each schooling level. It is given as:\n\n$$\nh_{t}=\\sum_{j=1}^{3} h r_{j, t} \\cdot d_{j, t}\n$$\n\nwhere $h_{t}$ stands for the average years of schooling, $h r_{j}$ is the estimated attainment ratio of the labor force and $d_{j}$ is the average number of years of education received in the respective schooling level j. Average education values have been calculated from the Encuesta Nacional Socio-Demográfica (ENS) from 1989 and are assumed to have remained constant over time. This may result in a slight overestimate of the human capital stock for the period prior to 1989 and underestimate the average years of schooling for later periods. However, data from more recent household surveys suggest that this assumption may not be a large source of error.\n\nFigure 2. Guatemala: Average Years of Schooling in Labor Force, 1950-2002\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nSource: Author's calculations, as well as Barro and Lee (2001), Cohen and Soto (2001), and Nehru et al. (1995) education data.\n\nHow do these calculations compare to other sources? The correlation coefficients between the estimated average years of schooling here and those provided by Soto (2002), Barro and Lee (2001), and Nehru et al. (1995), using different techniques and data sources, all exceed 0.95 in the case of Guatemala. Figure 2 compares the results. The time series shown by the solid line harmonizes to a large extent with alternative estimates at different points of time. Unlike the Barro and Lee data set, there is no",
      "25": "implausible jump for 1980. The Cohen and Soto (2002) estimate provides the closest approximation. Additionally, not shown by Figure 2, the average years of schooling estimates here come close to values obtained from census and survey data. For example, Psacharopoulos and Arriagada (1986) report that mean education in the labor force was in the order of 1.7 for 1964. Edwards (2002) reports a value of 4.3 years for 2000. According to the estimate here, average years of schooling was in the order of 1.9 years in 1964 and 4.4 years in 2000.\n\nA closer look at Figure 2 yields two important descriptive outcomes. First, the data suggest that mean education evident in the labor force slightly declined during the early 1990s. This outcome is associated with the disastrous effect of the civil war on the country's human capital base. Those disadvantaged cohorts from the 1980s entered later into the labor force. Second, there has been substantial increase in the average years of schooling within the economically active population since 1998. This can be attributed to improvements within the education system and increased attention to education after the signing of the 1996 Peace Accords.\n\nEven so, as it can be appreciated from Figure 2, this increased attention to education only has compensated for the loss of educational capital caused by civil strife. Consequently, recent educational progress does not represent a major improvement regarding the long-run growth of the country's human capital base. In this context, it is worth recalling that educational attainment in Guatemala remains lowest compared to other Latin American countries.\n\n# 4.2 Labor Force \n\nThe measure of labor quantity here is the economically active population. For Guatemala there are several estimates. The National Statistic Institute (INE) provides calculations different from those of the Ministry of Work, both of which date back to 1980. Based on census and survey data, estimates for selected years have also been provided by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for Guatemala. The labor force is usually defined as the working and job-seeking population, but the different calculations do not always reveal what underlies the specific assumptions and age definitions used for calculations. To develop a consistent time series of the economically active population, the International Labor Organisation (ILO) has used information on age specific labor force participation rates and population statistics. Unfortunately, for the reasons clarified below, these estimates are unreliable.\n(1) Data discrepancies. First, there is no agreement either on the level or on the growth rates of the labor force. Virtually all data is different from each other. For example, UNDP (2003a) reports a total labor force estimate of about 2.84 million for 1989, as compared to 2.54 million from INE or 2.95 million from ILO. Second, as typical for estimates in other countries, labor force data should show some cyclical fluctuations as labor responds to higher output growth. Official estimates for Guatemala, however, are remarkably free of any fluctuations and follow a",
      "26": "monotonous trend. This suggests reliance on population statistics or use of interpolation techniques.\n(2) Omission of the civil strife. Most importantly, these estimates do not take into account migration flows and the consequences of the civil war on the economically active population. Especially the last point devalues official estimates. According to the Commission for Historical Clarification (1999), the internal military conflict left an estimated 200,000 civilians dead and another 1 million displaced, for a total population of about 10 million. Such an immense impact of the civil strife should be reflected somewhere in the statistics? but it is not.\n\nFigure 3. Guatemala: Labor Force, 1950-2002 (millions of workers)\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nSource: Author's calculations based on Banco de Guatemala (2003), INE and ILO data.\nIn the absence of reliable information about the economically active population from these sources, labor is here proxied by the number of private contributors to the Guatemalan Social Security System (IGSS). The reliance on the number of private contributors to the Social Security System in order to account adequately for the economically active population is also adopted in an IMF study for the case of El Salvador by Morales (1998), and for Guatemala by Prera (1999). The numbers representing the labor force are calculated by assuming that the social security",
      "27": "contributors account for approximately 25 percent of the total labor force. ${ }^{14}$ The participation rate has a negligible impact on the later calculations and is based on a historical mean value.\n\nAlthough a broad approach may limit the precision of calculations, the regressions in sections 5 and 6 show that the variable has a high explanatory power on growth. Moreover, as can be seen from Figure 3, the estimated values give a more reasonable picture than the data from official sources. Notice that the level of the economically active population, but not its growth rate, is basically in line with ILO or INE calculations. In 1980s, when the civil war had already taken genocide proportions, the labor force dropped dramatically by about $660,000 .{ }^{15}$ For recent years, the estimate for the economically active population derived from IGSS statistics comes close to INE data.\n\n# 4.3 Physical Capital Stock \n\nInternationally, the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) is a common way to estimate capital stock, but there are uncertainties associated with the calculation. In general, due to the lack of information about the initial capital stock, questionable validity of assumptions about the rate of depreciation, and lack of information about the utilization of capital, estimates should be taken with care. With these reservations in mind, the PIM was used to construct the physical capital stock for Guatemala. The following paragraphs present two distinct calculations, one with aggregated and another with disaggregated investment data.\n\n## Estimate with Aggregated Investment Data\n\nThe physical capital stock that is used throughout the subsequent analyses is computed using the PIM with aggregated investment data. The procedure argues that the stock of capital is the accumulation of the stream of past investments:\n\n$$\nK_{t}=K_{t-1} \\cdot\\left(1-\\delta_{K}\\right)+I_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $K$ is the capital stock, $I$ gross fixed capital formation, $\\delta_{K}$ the annual depreciation rate of the capital stock, and $t$ an index for time. The initial value of the capital-output ratio for 1950 is taken from the Nehru and Dhareshwar (1993) data\n\nUNDP (2003a) reports a participation rate of 24.5 percent (2002). Based on INE data, as reported by Global Info Group (1999), this compares to 27.6 percent (1995), 29.9 percent (1990) and 28.2 percent (1985).\n\nIt should be emphasized that the reliance on IGSS data may understate the drop of the economically active population during the 1980s. This is because the working population in the informal and rural sectors-typically not captured by the social security system-was particularly affected by violence and displacement policies.",
      "28": "set. ${ }^{16}$ Information about gross fixed capital formation was provided directly by the Economic Research Department of the Banco de Guatemala. The data is compiled using the somewhat dated 1953 UN System of National Accounts, which is currently under revision. ${ }^{17}$ In line with other studies for Latin America, such as Loayza et al. (2002) and Morales (1998), the overall depreciation rate is assumed at 5 percent. This is still a rather high estimate when compared with more commonly used thumb values.\n\nHowever, regarding the armed conflict, which has lasted for 36 years, and several periods of high violence in Guatemala, it was found useful to adopt a high depreciation rate in order to account for both capital destruction and distraction from productive use. For example, the latter may have resulted in unprofitable military spending, several forms of non-productive investments, or temporary spare capital because of infrastructure deficiencies. As to be shown in the following section, the results of the regression analyses are not sensitive to moderate adjustments in the depreciation rate. In terms of data availability over a long time period, and given the robustness to alternative assumptions about depreciation, the capital stock series with aggregated investment data is adopted in the later regression analyses.\n\n# Estimate with Disaggregated Investment Data \n\nBased on the PIM, Morán and Valle (2002) present a second approach for Guatemala. In their model the capital stock is estimated for eight broad asset groups for 19712000. However, presumably because of too high depreciation rates for public and private construction, they seem to underestimate the genuine level of the capital stock. ${ }^{18}$ Following their methodology but applying different depreciation rates and taking into account the initial benchmark estimate from Nehru and Dareshwar (1993), a second capital stock series has been calculated with disaggregated investment data for the period 1970-2002.\n\nThe initial values are obtained from a pre-estimate starting in 1950. The data gaps for the sectoral composition of the eight assets groups prior to 1970 are filled in by extrapolation techniques. These values, however, do not enter in the later regression or growth accounting exercise. They only provide reasonable initial values for the\n\nThe potential error of the estimate of initial capital stock diminishes over time due to depreciation. Based on international data, Nehru and Dhareshwar (1993) offer an estimate of the capital stock for Guatemala that was taken as a benchmark.\n\nUNDP (2002) provides a brief summary of the associated empirical consequences and causes that prevented an actualization of the Guatemalan National Accounts.\n\nIn addition, the following results of the quality index for the physical capital stock differ. This may be due to the possibility of an oversight in the logarithmic transformation by Morán and Valle (2002), as was pointed out in a personal communication with Estuardo Morán, Banco de Guatemala, October 15, 2003.",
      "29": "disaggregated capital stock. Table 4 presents the assumed average life service lines for each of these assets groups. The average service life for a given class of asset is considered to be identical for all kinds of economic activities. The service lives are arrived at by considering the nature of these asset groups, consulting experts, and a careful review of the average service lives used by other countries, as reported in OECD (2001b).\n\nBased on average service life estimates, geometric depreciation rates are applied. With geometric depreciation, the market value in constant prices is assumed to decline at a constant rate within each period. The implicit depreciation factor for each asset group is set at a value that ensures that the initial value will have been reduced to 10 percent of the original value by the time it reaches the end of its expected service life. The main drawback of geometric depreciation is that it will never exhaust the full value of an asset. That is, the depreciated value of the asset falls asymptotically, approaching, but never reaching, zero. While the infinity problem is somewhat troublesome, geometric depreciation has the practical advantage of being suited better for benchmark estimates, such as in the present study.\n\nTable 4.

The quality index of the labor force will only be used in the later growth accounting exercise since it already reflects improvements in human capital. However, the estimate for the quality of capital enters into the regressions. The following paragraphs are concerned with the construction of the indices for the quality of capital and labor, respectively, and a brief comparison over both indices for 1970-2002. The capital and labor quality indices yield interesting outcomes.\n\n## Quality of Capital\n\nOne can calculate a quality index of capital by using the disaggregated capital stock data. The estimate follows the methodology advocated by Laurits et al. (1980) and",
      "30": "Roldós (1997). For the case of Guatemala, this means that changes in the index of quality of capital, $z q$, are computed as a weighted average of investment of the four broad asset groups. These are (1) public and private construction, (2) imported capital goods and investment in machinery and equipment, (3) domestically produced capital goods, and (4) cultivated assets and major improvements to land. The formula used is:\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\log z q_{t}=\\sum_{i=1}^{4} v_{i, t} \\cdot\\left(\\Delta \\log K_{t, t-1}\\right)-\\left(\\Delta \\log K_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $K_{t}$ is the respective capital stock and the weights $v_{t}$ are the relative capital rental rates. The index reflects changes in the composition of capital. If all components of the capital stock are growing at the same rate, quality remains unchanged. If components of the capital stock with higher capital rents are growing more rapidly, quality increases. Since data on the rental rates $v_{t}$ is not readily available for Guatemala, estimates of these are, following Roldós (1997), based on the arbitrage relation:\n\n$$\nv_{t, i}=\\left(1+r_{t}\\right) \\cdot P_{t, i}-\\left(1-\\delta_{Z, i}\\right) \\cdot P_{t, t+1}\n$$\n\nwhere $P_{t}$ is a price index, $\\delta_{Z, i}$ the depreciation rate, and $r_{t}$ is the economy-wide real interest rate. The price indices for the respective asset groups are taken from the Morán and Valle (2002) database. In order to take into account the volatility of the real exchange rate, which affects directly the relative price of the four types of capital, and to correct for measurement bias, the final series are smoothed by a 3-year moving average.\n\n# Quality of Labor \n\nTo quantify labor quality, an index $h q$ is computed as a weighted average of labor within different levels of education. This formulation is consistent with the growth accounting literature that makes adjustments for education. It allows a more accurate indication of the contribution of labor to production. The index $h q$ is defined as follows:\n\n$$\nh q_{t}=\\sum_{j=1}^{5} w_{j} \\cdot\\left(L_{j, t} / L_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $L_{j}$ is the labor force with education level $j$ (primary, secondary and tertiary) and $w_{j}$ are the weights for the respective schooling level. The weights measure how the productivity effect of schooling varies with the level of education and are taken from the later regression analysis (Table 6). Interestingly, they correspond approximately with the private returns to schooling at each education level, as presented by Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2002) for Guatemala.\n\nFollowing OECD (2001a) another possibility to compute an implicit labor quality index would be to assume direct relations between skills and occupations, to rank",
      "31": "occupations by their skill intensity and then use information on the occupational distribution of labor over time. In this case, skilled labor and less skilled labor have to be weighted by their respective relative labor productivity to account for differences in skills. For the case of Guatemala, similar to equation (14), this can be done by weighting labor inputs of different industries with the share that each type of labor occupies in total labor compensation.\n\nHowever, it should be kept in mind that this kind of implicit differentiation of labor is a rather incomplete substitute for labor quality. It can only take into account some of the quality changes of labor input and does not allow the sources of the change to be identified. Moreover, the eight industry categories available from Banco de Guatemala (2003) statistics only apply to the formal sector. As such, they ignore approximately 75 percent of the population working in the informal and rural economy. Placing less emphasis on educational improvements in primary schooling-the working population of the IGSS is typically better educated than the population in the informal and rural sectors-the implicit labor quality index is biased downwards. ${ }^{19}$\n\nFigure 4.

      "32": "Nevertheless, for illustrative purposes, Figure 4 compares both indices. What is striking is the apparent similarity between both measures of labor quality despite completely different sources of data. This suggests that the time series properties of the human capital stock and its respective weights may be of reasonable quality.\n\n# Comparison of Both Indices \n\nFinally, Figure 5 compares the estimated indices of the quality of labor, $h q$, and capital, $z q$. The descriptive analysis yields three important outcomes. First, the index of labor quality presents a clear upward trend, reflecting improvements in educational capital and a shift to more skilled jobs. However, as a consequence of the civil strife, labor quality slightly declined during the early 1990s but begins to increase again after 1998.\n\nSecond, the quality of capital has decreased over time. In particular after 1977, the data suggests that capital quality declined dramatically. In the mid 1990s, the advent of the Peace Accords led to an improvement, followed, however, by a stagnant pattern. In any case, for the period under observation, the quality of Guatemala's capital stock declined by about 20 percent. The exact reasons underlying the deterioration are unclear and require further research. Prominent explanations are the destructive impact of the internal military conflict, and a negative investment climate due to an unstable policy environment and lack of good governance.\n\nFigure 5. Guatemala: Indices of Capital and Labor Quality, 1970-2002 (in percent, relative to base year 1970) ${ }^{\\text {a/ }}$\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nSource: Author's calculations. a/ Changes in capital quality reflect the fact that investment with comparatively higher rental rates (imported capital goods as well as machinery and equipment) decreased during the civil war but eventually climbed up again.",
      "33": "Third, a comparison of both indices shows an apparent gap between the evolution of the quality of capital and the quality of labor. This could imply that the deterioration of quality of capital is associated with, among other factors, the decreased output growth during the last decades. In other words, there is a missing complementarity between the country's skills and its technology base. The next section will take a closer look at the empirical determinants of growth in Guatemala.\n\n# 5. Empirical Evidence for Guatemala \n\nThis section presents the main empirical evidence regarding the relationship between education and growth in Guatemala. Section 5.1 introduces the empirical methodology. Section 5.2 reports the findings for average years of schooling and growth. Given the apparent shortcoming of aggregate measurements of human capital, section 5.3 examines separately the effects of primary, secondary and tertiary schooling on growth. Finally, section 5.4 compares the returns to education at the macro level with the microeconomic evidence.\n\n### 5.1 Methodology\n\nThe empirical methodology for the following sections is based on the human capital augmented growth model of Mankiw et al. (1992). This model considers human capital as an independent factor of production. It can be represented in a CobbDouglas production function with constant returns to scale:\n\n$$\nY_{t}=A_{t} \\cdot K_{t}^{\\alpha} \\cdot H_{t}^{\\beta} \\cdot L_{t}^{(1-\\alpha-\\beta)}\n$$\n\nwhere $Y$ represents output and $A$ is the level of technology or total factor productivity. ${ }^{20} K, H$ and $L$ are physical capital, human capital and labor. Multicollinearity between capital and labor is avoided by standardizing output and the capital stock by labor units, which also impose the restriction that the scale elasticity of the production factors is equal to unity. Converted into a logarithmic expression, the production function can be estimated in its structural form:\n\n$$\n\\log y_{t}=\\log A_{t}+\\alpha \\cdot \\log k_{t}+\\beta \\cdot \\log h_{t}+u_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere the lower case variables $y=Y / L$ and $k=K / L$ are output and physical capital in intensive terms, and $h=H / L$ stands for average human capital. At first glance, the\n\nFurther research may focus on a specification less restrictive than a standard Cobb-Douglas production function to allow a higher degree of precision for the determination of the technical coefficients. For example, factor shares are not necessarily constant, and the elasticity of substitution can be less than 1. A potentially interesting avenue is Jones (2004). He presents a production function that exhibits a short-run elasticity of substitution between capital and labor that is less than 1 , and a long-run elasticity that equals to 1 .",
      "34": "formula already appears suitable for estimation. However, some problems arise since it is well known that most macroeconomic time series contain unit roots and that the regression of one non-stationary series on another is likely to yield spurious results. As reported in the Appendix, the data for Guatemala is no exception. The estimation bias can be removed by transforming the time series to stationarity. This can be done by first differencing. In any case, this will create its own problems, notably because of the risk of losing valuable information on the long-run relationships of the variables.\n\nOne approach to dealing with this dilemma is to employ an error-correction model which combines long-run information with a short-run adjustment mechanism. This methodology has been used successfully in alternative growth studies. Examples of this are Nehru and Dareshwar (1994), Morales (1998), and Bassanini and Scarpetta (2001). The error-correction model can be estimated in different ways. Banerjee et al. (1993) show that the generalized one-step error-correction model is a transformation of an autoregressive distributed lag model. As such, it can be used to estimate relationships among non-stationary processes. Based on Hendry's (1995) concept of general-to-specific modeling, the error-correction model of the human capital augmented production function for Guatemala can be specified as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta \\log y_{t}=\\gamma_{1} \\cdot \\Delta \\log k_{t}+\\gamma_{2} \\cdot \\Delta \\log k_{t-1} \\\\\n&-\\gamma_{3} \\cdot\\left(\\log y_{t-1}-\\alpha \\cdot \\log k_{t-1}-\\beta \\cdot \\log h_{t-1}-\\log A_{t-1}\\right)+u_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFor Guatemala, in line with much empirical cross-country research, the short-run effects of schooling on growth have been found insignificant and are as such excluded from the regressions. This suggests that only the level of human capital has a long-run effect on economic growth. As it stands, the equation can be estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS) or instrumental variables (IV) techniques, but the coefficients cannot be formed without knowledge of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. However, one can estimate the re-parameterized form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\log y_{t}=c+ & \\gamma_{1} \\cdot \\Delta \\log k_{t}+\\gamma_{2} \\cdot \\Delta \\log k_{t-1} \\\\\n& +\\gamma_{3} \\cdot \\log y_{t-1}+\\gamma_{4} \\cdot \\log k_{t-1}+\\gamma_{5} \\cdot \\log h_{t-1}+\\sum_{j} \\delta_{j} \\cdot \\operatorname{dummy}_{j, t}+u_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nEstimates of the parameter $\\gamma_{3}$ can now be used to calculate the required elasticities $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The loading coefficient $\\gamma_{3}$ contains additional information because it can be interpreted as a measure of the speed of adjustment in which the system moves towards its equilibrium on the average. In addition, Banerjee et al. (1998) argue that in a single equation framework a significant coefficient serves as a test for cointegration. Notice that the technology parameter, $A$, is allowed to change overtime as a function of different variables, $Z$ :\n\n$$\n\\log A_{t}=f\\left(Z_{t}\\right)\n$$",
      "35": "where in its simplest formulation the technology level is proxied by a constant term, $c$, and a series of dummy variables. In a later section, proxy variables with respect to growth of trade openness, bad governance, time trends and other variables will be included in the equation. The majority of the following regressions include three dummies. First, a 1963 impulse dummy captures a positive one-off effect stemming from expectations regarding the Central American Common Market (MCCA). Second, a 1982 impulse dummy takes into account a negative one-off effect stemming from the peak of internal war. Third, a 1977 step dummy which models a structural change in the long-run relationship of the variables. A Chow breakpoint test does not reject the null hypothesis of no structural change during that year ( $\\mathrm{p}=$ 0.000 ).\n\nIn fact, the 1977 dummy is always negative, very significant, and most likely corrects for the deviations resulting from the civil strife. Interestingly, this finding is consistent with the quality index of the capital stock series showing a decreasing trend since 1977. ${ }^{21}$\n\n# 5.2 Average Years of Schooling and Growth \n\nTable 5 shows the results for the average years of schooling specification. The adjusted $\\mathrm{R}^{2}$ of the error-correction model is rather high and indicates a good data fit. Test statistics do not indicate any serial correlation or misspecification at conventional levels. The residuals have been found to be normally distributed and to follow stationary patterns. If not mentioned otherwise, these properties apply equally to subsequent regressions. The loading coefficient is highly significant and suggests a moderate speed of adjustment towards the long-run growth path, equal to about 25 percent of the deviations per year. After any specific shock to the economy it would, on the average, take approximately 10 years to reach the level of output consistent with long-run growth (with differences to be less than 10 percent). In the subsequent regressions, however, the magnitude of the coefficient? but not its significance? was found to be fragile with respect to the econometric specification. The asymptotic critical values of the t-ratio for the coefficient are taken from Banerjee et al. (1998). The significance level suggests a cointegrating relationship of the variables. ${ }^{22}$\n\nEvidently, the Guatemalan time series are full of distortions, for example the 1976 earthquake and major political events. However, a sparse inclusion of dummy variables is the preferred econometric formulation. Other settings will be described in the following sections. It is important to emphasize that the bas ic results are not sensitive to the dummy variables. That is, the omission of the impulse dummies (1963 and 1982) does have little impact on the qualitative results. However, it is important to model the structural break.\n\nNotice equally that the human capital parameters are highly significant and compare favorably with the critical values provided by Pesaran et al. (2001). This is reassuring given the small sample size of 50 observations and the consequently low power of the ADF tests, where the stationarity properties of the repressors may not be known with certainty.",

      "37": "The results are satisfactory considering the distortions caused by the internal military conflict and the simplicity of the assumptions used to construct the time series in the context of data uncertainties. At first sight, this seems astonishing. However, the good performance of the model may be due to the small size of the economy, and that the overall data uncertainties are not as severe as is commonly believed.\n\nThe most striking result is that human capital, as measured by average years of schooling, has a highly significant, positive and strong impact on long-run growth. Column 1 reports the implicit long-run coefficients estimated by OLS. ${ }^{23}$ Since education levels are likely to respond to growing employment opportunities and increased income, column 2 shows the regression results when IV techniques are applied. In this case, lags of the explanatory variables are used as instruments. Compared to the OLS estimate, the quality of the results does not vary much with the IV estimation. The estimating parameters are in both cases significantly different from zero and the regressions, as test statistics indicate, show a satisfactory performance. However, the absolute value of the human capital coefficient is slightly reduced.\n\nBy contrast, the implicit elasticity of the capital coefficient is sharply reduced. The endogeneity problem, thus, does not distort the estimate but has an impact on the magnitude of the coefficients. In the IV specification, the estimated long-run effect of a 1 percent increase of average schooling on GDP per unit of labor is 0.33 percent. As such, it is roughly consistent with a priori expectations on the magnitude of the factor share of human capital. The results in terms of the human capital augmented CobbDouglas production function are approximately as follows:\n\n$$\nY_{t}=A_{t} \\cdot K_{t}^{1 / 3} \\cdot H_{t}^{1 / 3} \\cdot L_{t}^{1 / 3}\n$$\n\nwhere the reported parameter values will serve as the base in a later growth accounting exercise. Notice that despite different methodologies the capital elasticity is broadly in line with empirical analyses which estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function for Guatemala (see Box 3). The capital elasticity, however, was found to be sensitive regarding the setting of the dummy variables. By contrast, the human capital coefficient was robust. These issues will be explored in more detail in the following analyses.\n\nFinally, there are two additional findings of interest. First, even in the IV estimate, physical capital accumulation has a rather high impact on short-run growth. This suggests that measures to stimulate investment, for example by improving the investment climate, are likely to have an immediate impact on short-run growth.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    23 The long-run coefficients can be obtained by dividing the estimated parameter through the value of the loading coefficient, for example $0.084 / 0.241^{\\prime \\prime} 0.351$. Discrepancies are due to rounding.",
      "38": "Second, the interception is significantly negative. Since the constant is expected to proxy for technology, a negative parameter in the sense of 'technological regress' is hard to understand. However, a loose interpretation for this finding would be that during the past 50 years, on average, the economy was not particularly efficient. One reason for that might be the conflictive political and social environment of Guatemala.\n\n# Box 3. Empirical Growth Studies for Guatemala: A Review \n\nThere are no studies for Guatemala that empirically assess the direct impact of education on economic growth over time. However, some standard growth accounting regressions exist that partially confirm the findings of the present study.\n\nPrera (1999) and the World Bank (1996) came up with rough capital share estimates of about 0.4 and 0.6 , respectively, while estimating a Cobb-Douglas production function. The World Bank provides neither a detailed methodology nor its data sources. The study from Prera faces several constraints regarding these issues. Particularly the fact that he ignores the existence of unit roots within the time series context and the low significance of the estimated parameters places doubt on the reliability of the results. Morán and Valle (2002) face the same problems. In addition, their parameter estimates must be considered carefully because of a short time period. The capital share is estimated about 0.3 . Segovia and Lardé (2002) find a similar capital share using a first differences specification. Although the methodologies and data sources differ, the results partially suggest that the capital share for Guatemala is in agreement with empirical studies for other developing countries. According to Bosworth et al. (1996), capital shares are typically considered to be in the order of 0.3-0.4.\n\nSome growth accounting studies for Guatemala also exist. Results differ and no firm conclusions can be drawn. The main discrepancies stem from the assumed or estimated factor shares, distinct time periods and, in particular, from data issues. Most studies rely on international data sets. They make no adjustments for the quality of inputs and are not concerned too much about data problems in the light of the civil strife. In general, studies tend to find that the role of total factor productivity growth was moderate and decreasing for recent periods. (with the exception of Bailén 2001, see for example Bosworth et al. 1996, Edwards 2000, Gregorio 1992, Loayza et al. 2002, Morán and Valle 2002, Nehru and Dhareshwar 1994, Segovia and Lardé 2002, Prera 1999, and World Bank 1996).\n\nParticularly interesting is the work of Sakellariou (1995) who claims to use the Lucas (1988) model of endogenous growth. While analyzing microdata from the 1989 household survey, Sakellariou tests external effects of education on wage differentials. Unfortunately, the study suffers from a limited number of industry categories and human capital variables. Consequently, the regressions turn out to be statistically insignificant and strong conclusions cannot be drawn. However, Sakellariou goes as far as finding that the analysis does not reject the hypothesis that external effects of human capital investment could be present in Guatemala.\n\n### 5.3 Schooling and Growth by Education Level\n\nUsing education data by levels may be preferable for a number of reasons. In particular, the growth impact of different forms of educational capital may vary. Columns 1-6 in Table 6 present the results of the production function augmented for human capital. The education level of the labor force enters separately into the estimation. The share of the labor force with primary, secondary and tertiary education is used here as the relevant unit. It may be argued that average years of schooling by level of education should be used instead of labor force participation. In any case, with the given data, this would not change the results. Ideally, one would",
      "39": "also include primary, secondary and tertiary education into the same equation in order to assess their joint impact on growth. However, due to strong collinearity, the estimation only supports the inclusion of one education level. ${ }^{24}$ As can be appreciated from the test statistics the regressions perform quite well. Notice that the estimate for primary education includes a time trend starting in 1985, the year of Guatemala's transition to civilian rule. The inclusion of the trend variable was motivated to avoid serial correlation in the residuals, but does not have an impact on the magnitude of coefficients.\n\nTable 6 presents both OLS and IV estimates. The endogeneity problem seems to be more pronounced for primary education, and in particular for physical capital. However, the qualitative results do not vary substantially. In all specifications the schooling variables are highly significant and positively correlated with growth. Interestingly, the significance levels increase with secondary and tertiary education. Regarding the long-run elasticities, the accumulation of primary schooling appears to be most important for growth, followed by secondary and tertiary education. This finding should not be interpreted as implying that other levels are unimportant. This is particularly true given the tight connections between the various forms of educational capital and the retrospective character of the empirics. Nevertheless, the evidence is in line with the limited cross-country studies on this topic. Recall that Gemmel (1996), Petrakis and Stamatakis (2002) and Papageorgiou (2003) plausibly suggest that the importance of post-primary education increases with the level of development. Similarly, de Ferranti et al. (2002) argue that in countries classified as adopters, such as Guatemala, policies should first focus on a critical threshold level of primary schooling, coupled with open trade policies. The intuition is here that different stages of technological transition require distinct policy priorities. A sufficient coverage and quality of primary education are regarded as the minimum prerequisite to adopt technologies. By contrast, in countries where basic skill requirements are fulfilled and firms are making significant adaptations or innovations, the creation of more specialized skills ought to be the priority. In addition, the results here partially confirm the earlier micro-level evidence for Guatemala. ${ }^{25}$\n\nIn principle, the inclusion of a time trend for 1999 and an interaction term for secondary and tertiary schooling would allow incorporating all three levels of education at a time. Tentatively, such an exercise yields similar qualitative results on the impact of each level of education on growth—albeit primary schooling becomes insignificant. In addition, due to the multicollinearity problem, this specification was found to be rather sensitive and performs less well than the results displayed in Table 6.\n\nFor Guatemala, Psacharopoulos and others have extensively investigated the returns to schooling, sometimes by level of education. Such exercises are summarized in Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2002), Haeussler (1993) and World Bank (1995). The studies generally report high private returns to primary schooling, but are merely based on ENS (1989) or earlier data, and typically do not care about sample selection bias.",

      "41": "Finally, it is interesting to observe the changes of the physical capital coefficients by level of education. In the IV specification for primary and secondary schooling, capital only enters as weakly significant. By contrast, the coefficient for physical capital becomes very significant and alters its long-run elasticity if tertiary education is entered into the estimate.\n\nTo the extent that this effect does not merely reflect statistical arbitrariness, a possible interpretation would be that the productivity of physical capital is affected by tertiary schooling. These findings support the conjecture of Romer (1990b) that the level of scientific education should be correlated with the rate of growth and the share of output devoted to investment in physical capital. It should be kept in mind, however, that the reliability of tertiary education data is comparatively poor in Guatemala. Moreover, according to Anderson (2001), low quality and internal inefficiency plague university education. Hence, some care should be taken before drawing too strong conclusions from the observed changes.\n\n# 5.4 Mincerian Human Capital Specification \n\nAn important question is how the effect of schooling at the macro level compares with the microeconomic evidence. The macro returns could be higher because of externalities from education. For example, if post-primary schooling leads to technological progress that is not captured in the private returns to education, or if education produces externalities in the form of the reduction of crime, more informed political decisions, better health and so on. To reconcile the macro effect of schooling with the micro level, Cohen and Soto (2001) estimate the following production function:\n\n$$\nY_{t}=A_{t} \\cdot K_{t}^{\\alpha} \\cdot H M_{t}^{(1-\\alpha)}\n$$\n\nwhere $Y$ is output, $A$ total factor productivity, $K$ physical capital, and $H M$ human capital. As first suggested by Bils and Klenow (2000), the micro evidence derived from a log-linear Mincer (1974) formulation can be used to specify the aggregate human capital stock as follows:\n\n$$\nH M_{t}=e^{\\psi \\cdot h_{t}} \\cdot L_{t} \\Leftrightarrow h m_{t}=e^{\\psi \\cdot h_{t}}\n$$\n\nwhere $h m_{t}$ is the human capital per worker, $h_{t}$ is average years of schooling and $\\psi$ corresponds to the returns to education. This Mincerian approach has become popular in the literature since the work of Bils and Klenow. ${ }^{26}$ The specification is a straightforward way of incorporating human capital into the production function in a\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    26 The working paper version was circulated prior to 2000. A caveat here is the missing role of experience.",
      "42": "manner that is consistent with the standard semi-logarithmic formulation for estimating returns to schooling at the micro level.\n\nNevertheless, Temple (2001) argues that the parameter $\\psi$ may not be interpreted as the social returns to schooling because it does not incorporate the opportunity costs of the resources used in educational provision. Still, it remains of considerable interest since an empirical estimate provides a way of either confirming or rejecting the importance of education suggested by micro studies.\n\nFor the Guatemalan case, the econometric specification is similar to the previous equations. The production function is first converted into a logarithmic expression:\n\n$$\n\\log y_{t}=\\log A_{t}+\\alpha \\cdot \\log k_{t}+(1-\\alpha) \\cdot \\psi \\cdot h_{t}\n$$\n\nThen, the production function is transformed into an error-correction formulation, which allows the long-run schooling parameter to be identified:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta \\log y_{t}=\\gamma_{1} \\cdot \\Delta \\log k_{t}+\\gamma_{2} \\cdot \\Delta \\log k_{t-1} \\\\\n& \\quad-\\gamma_{3} \\cdot\\left(\\log y_{t-4}-\\alpha \\cdot \\log k_{t-4}-(1-\\alpha) \\cdot \\psi \\cdot h_{t-1}-\\log A_{t-1}\\right)+u_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFinally, the error-correction model is re-parameterized and includes a series of dummy variables:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta \\log y_{t}=c+\\gamma_{1} \\cdot \\Delta \\log k_{t}+\\gamma_{2} \\cdot \\Delta \\log k_{t-1} \\\\\n& +\\gamma_{3} \\cdot \\log y_{t-1}+\\gamma_{4} \\cdot \\log k_{t-1}+\\gamma_{5} \\cdot h_{t-1}+\\sum_{j} \\delta_{j} \\cdot \\text { dummy }_{j, t}+u_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNotice that the implicit return to schooling can be calculated with knowledge of $\\alpha$ and $\\gamma_{3}$. In principle, this approach would also allow the productivity effect of schooling to be differentiated by education level, as mentioned by Wößmann (2003). Unfortunately, the results here were found unstable for disaggregated education data. This is presumably due to the missing logarithmic transformation of the schooling variables.\n\nInsofar, the specification provides an attractive way for comparing macro and micro evidence on the returns to schooling, but in a time series context tends to produce fragile parameter estimates. Nevertheless, when using aggregated data on human capital the regressions perform quite satisfactorily. Table 7 presents the results. Controlling for endogeneity does not distort the empirics.

      "44": "additional year of schooling increases income per worker by approximately 18.4 percent. ${ }^{27}$ This number suggests that the macro return to schooling in Guatemala is rather high, but it compares favorably with earlier microeconomic evidence. For example, the World Bank (1995) reports a private return to schooling of 14.9 percent for Guatemala. ${ }^{28}$ There is evidence for much lower returns in the informal sectors and for decreasing patterns over time, but the magnitude of the coefficient is echoed in Funkhouser (1997). An estimate from Haeussler (1993) based on 1989 survey and Ministry of Education data suggests that, depending on the schooling level and underlying assumptions, the social return to schooling lies in a band between 13-19 percent. Finally, these results also confirm the cross-country evidence from Cohen and Soto (2001). They essentially find that in macro and micro regressions the effect of education on income is of similar magnitude.\n\n# 6. Robustness Check and Additional Explanatory Variables \n\nThis section seeks to answer some basic questions. How much confidence should be placed on the previous results? Evidently, given certain data restrictions and distortions caused by the civil war, a key issue is if the previous findings can be used to derive firm policy conclusions. In addition, another important aspect is considered: does the conditioning information set cause the schooling coefficients to change?\n\nIn order to answer these questions, the following paragraphs are organized as follows. Section 6.1 tests the stability of the variables. By comparing the results with alternative sources, section 6.2 includes time trends, and analyzes the reliability of the human and physical capital stock data. Section 6.3, the bulk of the analysis, includes additional variables explaining growth. An overview of the alternative data is presented in Figure 7. Additional variables are the quality of capital, trade openness, terms of trade, and imported capital goods. This section also examines the effect of life expectancy as a companion indicator for human capital. In addition the role of military expenditures is analyzed, which, among others things, may serve as a proxy for bad governance in Guatemala. Section 6.4 closes with a brief summary of the findings.\n\n### 6.1 Stability of Coefficients\n\nGiven the distortions of the economy by the civil strife and other events, it is imperative to evaluate the stability of the coefficients. For example, comparing data\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    27 According to the Table, the implicit return to schooling can be calculated as follows: $(0.034 / 0.240) /(1-0.240)^{\\wedge} 0.184$. Discrepancies are due to rounding.\n\n    Based on ENCOVI (2000) survey data the World Bank (2003a) reports an overall rate of return of 6 percent.",
      "45": "Figure 6. Parameter Stability: Recursive Coefficients - Production Function with Average Years of Schooling Specification, 1988-2002\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nNote: Based on the OLS estimate presented in Table 5, column 1.",
      "46": "from different points of time could cause coefficients to show dramatic jumps. In this case, it would be almost impossible to interpret the magnitude and sign of the coefficients. In order to test for instability, this section evaluates parameter stability using recursive least squares. This allows a year-by-year comparison of the coefficients since ever larger subsets of the time series data are used in the regression.\n\nWith reference to the production function augmented for human capital, Figure 6 visualizes the recursive coefficients of the regression (Table 5) estimated by OLS. Also shown are the standard error bands around the coefficients. The coefficients do not display significant variations when more data is added to the equation. This is in particular true for the schooling parameter and indicates stability. In the light of permanent shocks to the Guatemalan economy, it is reassuring to note that the coefficient plots do not show significant jumps since the error-correction specification here is capable of digesting these disruptive events. Due to space limitations Figure 6 does not include the recursive coefficients for the 3 dummy variables, although they have been found to be equally stable. Parameter stability was found satisfactory as well using a Mincerian human capital specification (Table 7) or employing disaggregated data on educational attainment (Table 6).\n\n# 6.2 Alternative Data Sources \n\nThe estimates in this study ultimately rely on constructed time series. Consequently it is possible to ask: May the earlier results be related to arbitrary improvements during the stage of data construction? In order to pre-empt any suggestions of data mining, in particular with reference to the human and physical capital stock, this section discusses the use of alternative data sources. The benchmark for the subsequent variations in the data is the production function augmented for human capital (see Table 5).\n\nThe results of the sensitive tests are reported in Table 8. In general, the following regressions do not perform as well as the earlier estimates but still satisfactorily pass conventional tests. A Breusch-Godfrey serial correlation test suggests the possibility that the estimates (only in column 1 and 4) might present mild evidence ( $p<0.15$ ) of first order serial correlation. Since the indication was weak and would make little impact, no correction for it was attempted. In addition, the nature of the following exercise does not necessitate absolute precision but rather enriches the earlier findings. The following results suggest in general that the findings are not sensitive to the conditioning data set but rather strengthen the final conclusions about the importance of human capital.\n\n## Inclusion of Time Trends\n\nColumn 1 of Table 8 presents the original estimate for average years of schooling (Table 5), and also includes two time trends in order to account for the possibility of missing explanatory variables. The inclusion of the trend variables was motivated by",

      "48": "a look at the residual plot of the earlier estimates. They show moderate variations during these time periods, in particular since 1999.\n\nThe inclusion of the trend variables does not have a substantial impact on the significance level of the long-run elasticities, albeit the magnitude of the coefficients is moderately affected. While the schooling coefficient decreases minimally, the physical capital coefficient is augmented. The time trend for 1985 is significantly positive but there is a negative trend since 1999. Interestingly, both time periods are related to political events. 1985 is the transition year to civilian rule. 1999 is the election year of the Alfonso Portillo government, where compromised representatives of the former military nomenclature are suspected of wielding political power.\n\nTo the extent that this association is correct, a loose interpretation would suggest that in Guatemala the strengthening (weakening) of civilian rule has a significant positive (negative) impact on long-run growth. While at first sight this interpretation appears plausible, however, it is obvious that other factors are important as well. Moreover, the growth-enhancing channel of democratic rights might be operating indirectly on some independent variables, such as educational attainment. This complicates the analysis. Hence, further research is needed to strengthen this hypothesis.\n\n# Alternative Capital Stock Data \n\nColumn 2 of Table 8 includes capital stock data with a 4 percent depreciation rate rather than the 5 percent thumb value assumed throughout this study. The data with 4 percent depreciation is essentially identical to the Nehru and Dareshwar (1993) capital stock series, despite some minor discrepancies? when compared with data from Banco de Guatemala? on investment. Assuming 4 percent depreciation of the capital stock has little impact on the results, although in the IV specification the significance of the capital coefficient is weakened. This suggests that a 4 percent depreciation is rather on the low side.\n\nColumn 3 includes the capital stock estimate built with disaggregated investment data originally constructed to compute the quality index for capital. This series is robustly correlated with growth. The long-run elasticities for physical and human capital are slightly higher than with the standard estimate of the capital stock. Due to the limited number of observations the regression could only be run by OLS. Thus, the coefficients are likely to be upwardly biased. Altogether, varying the assumptions about the depreciation rate moderately changes capital elasticities but does not change very much the role of human capital on growth.\n\n## Alternative Schooling Data\n\nThe most interesting sensitive test concerns the validity of the conclusions on the importance of human capital to growth. Column 4 uses interpolated education data from Barro and Lee (2001). Column 5 includes the interpolated time series from Cohen and Soto (2001) into the regressions. In both estimates human capital, as measured by average years of schooling, is robustly correlated with growth.",

      "51": "In addition, the parameter estimate yields a long-run elasticity in the range of 0.29 0.39 . This magnitude is similar to the benchmark results obtained in the earlier estimate. Given the interpolated nature of these sources, a too strong interpretation of the associated changes makes little sense. Insofar, the sign and significance of the variables are more important than their magnitude. All in all, employing alternative data on human capital confirms the earlier conclusions about the importance of education on growth.\n\n# Population Instead of Labor Force Estimate \n\nThe regression in column 6 employs population data (15-64 years) instead of the labor force. Alternatively ILO labor force estimates could be used. The time series properties, however, are almost identical, and population statistics refer to a longer time period. In any case, the results are rather disappointing. That is, the significance of the coefficients and the overall fit of the model are poor. In order to ameliorate the estimate, the lag structure of the short-run capital coefficients was modified.\n\nHuman capital still enters positively but is only weakly significant. A puzzling finding is that long-run capital accumulation has now a negative impact on growth, which is a counterintuitive and implausible result. Overall, given the absence of fluctuations and considering the civil war, Guatemalan population data seems to be a poor proxy for labor as well.\n\n### 6.3 Additional Explanatory Variables\n\nWhen the conditioning set of data in the regressions is modified, it is interesting to observe changes in the explanatory variables, such as schooling. For example, the production elasticities of human or physical capital could be larger than their factor shares because of presumed externalities. The benchmarks of the following analyzes are the results in section 5 . When possible, the following paragraphs differentiate for the effect of primary, secondary and tertiary schooling.\n\n## Quality-Adjustment Capital\n\nColumn 2 of Table 10 shows an OLS estimate for the period 1971-2002 when the capital stock is adjusted for quality. For comparative purposes, column 1 presents the same regression but without such an adjustment. Following de Ferranti et al. (2002) the intuition behind this exercise is that embodied technological change could have a positive impact on the returns to education, in particular for post-primary schooling. However, in the case of Guatemala, the overall effect seems to be the opposite. An increase in the long-run elasticity for physical capital and a decrease of the importance of education on growth is found.\n\nTo interpret this puzzling finding recall that the index of capital quality actually measures a decay by about 20 percent. In contrast, human capital and hence labor quality, have increased substantially over time. This may point in the direction of a",
      "52": "missing capital-skill complementarity in Guatemala, which would tend to reduce the returns to education. Interestingly, this effect impacts mainly on primary education. If one compares the respective elasticities of Table 6 (columns 1, 3 and 5) and Table 9 (columns 1, 3 and 5) the econometric results suggest that introducing quality adjustments for capital have little effect on secondary and tertiary education. Nevertheless, given the limited sample size of only 31 observations a word of caution is required here. These findings should be strengthened by additional research.\n\n# Trade Openness \n\nGrowth is often thought to be enhanced by trade openness. Apart from comparativeadvantage arguments, it is argued that openness expands potential markets, facilitates the diffusion of technological innovations, improves managerial practices and promotes domestic competition, all of which increase efficiency. Considering the small size of the Guatemalan economy trade openness is of particular interest. For case of Latin America, Loayza et al. (2002) present evidence suggesting a significant relationship between trade openness and growth.\n\nColumn 3 of Table 10 suggests that the growth rate of trade openness is positively and significantly related to Guatemalan GDP growth. By contrast, the elasticities for physical and average human capital do not show significant variations. This finding changes, however, if disaggregated data on educational attainment is entered into the estimate. Table 9 reveals that the inclusion of the growth rate of trade openness alters the coefficient for primary education, while secondary and tertiary schooling remain more or less unchanged (columns 2, 4 and 6). The parameters for post-primary schooling are of a similar magnitude as those in the earlier estimate which did not consider trade openness (Table 6, columns 1, 3 and 5). Interestingly, in both cases, the coefficients for post-primary schooling are of almost identical magnitude, which is also an indication of robustness. The fact that trade affects only primary education may suggest that, over the past decades, general education and basic technical skills have been the key determinants for the diffusion of technological innovations. Or, more generally, the people with primary education seem to benefit particularly from the effects of trade openness.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, the econometric evidence reveals that trade openness, as measured by the trade volume over GDP, exhibits a short-run effect on growth. The long-run coefficient was found insignificant and as such excluded from the model. A possible interpretation of this finding points in the direction of Rodríguez and Rodrik (2000). They cast doubt on the robustness with respect to measurement concepts and specifications of the bulk of the empirical evidence on this topic. Instead, they suggest exploring alternative causal interpretations. For example, an additional indirect channel might be that more-open economies adopt better policies and institutions that explain part of the effects of openness on growth. Following this interpretation, hitherto, trade openness in Guatemala has not been associated with political change (see also Box 1).",
      "53": "Column 3 indicates that improvement in the terms of trade, that is, a higher growth of the ratio of export prices to import prices, seem to enhance short-run economic growth. In line with the effect of trade openness, the long-run coefficient was found insignificant. However, the positive impact of terms of trade growth must be regarded with some caution. This is essentially because its significance was found fragile considering the conditioning set of variables that enter into the regression.\n\n# Foreign Capital Goods \n\nInternational trade may have an additional impact on growth through the imports of foreign capital goods. Lee (1995) emphasizes that developing countries can increase the efficiency of capital accumulation and thereby the rate of growth by importing relatively cheap foreign capital goods from higher income countries. Taking into account this potential avenue of trade on growth, the ratio of capital imports to total investment is used as a proxy variable for the efficiency of capital accumulation. The regression of column 4 in Table 10 indicates that the composition of investment is indeed an important determinant for long-run growth in Guatemala. The implied elasticity suggests that a 1 percent increase in the ratio of capital imports to total investment increases output by about 0.10 percent. This supports the idea of Lee that more use of imported capital goods increases the efficiency of capital accumulation. Therefore, any trade distortion that restricts the importation of capital goods damages the economy in the long run. Such distortions also include disincentives for trade, such as a climate that discourages investment. Thus, continuing political instability and a climate of violence dampens the prospective for growth not only for the present, but also for future.\n\nNotice that the inclusion of the variable alters the coefficients for capital accumulation but has little impact on the elasticity of average years of schooling. Unfortunately, measuring the impact of foreign capital goods on schooling by level of education was hampered by implausibly high, albeit positive, parameter estimates for schooling. Tentatively, such an exercise reveals an altering of the coefficients for primary education but has little impact on secondary and tertiary schooling. This clearly supports the earlier finding of the effect of trade openness on growth by level of education.\n\n## Life Expectancy\n\nGiven the incomplete nature of education to proxy for human capital, a look at the effect of the health status yields important insights. Column 5 includes life expectancy at birth into the regression. The schooling variable is removed due to collinearity. The health variable is highly significant and has a very strong impact on long-run growth. The estimate suggests that a 1 percent increase in life expectancy would increase output by about 1.04 percent. Barro (2001) suggests that the variable has such a strong impact on growth because it may proxy for features other than health, such as social capital, better work habits and a higher level of skill. The elasticities could be biased due to the reliance on interpolated data sources.",
      "54": "Nevertheless, the results support the view that human capital policies in Guatemala should place a strong emphasis on the health status of the population. This finding is equally echoed by the World Bank (2003a) that places Guatemala among the worst performers in terms of health outcome in Latin America, and particular poor in child nutrition.\n\n# Military Expenditures and Governance \n\nGiven the strong influence of military rule in Guatemala's recent history, it is finally imperative to discuss the role of military expend iture on growth. ${ }^{29}$ This issue is particularly important since in the light of Guatemala's low tax burden military expenditures will necessarily be met at the expense of other government services, such as education and health. Military spending shows the priority given to other fiscal functions by the government and serves as an indicator of the military's power as a lobby. As such, Guatemalan military expenditures may also indicate political corruption and other aspects of bad government.\n\nHowever, a number of channels by which military spending can influence growth have been identified. According to Deger and Sen (1995), the defense sector can take skilled labor away from civilian production, but it can also train workers. It could crowd out resources for investment and impact negatively on the efficiency of resource allocation, but also provide positive externalities for the civilian sector, such as infrastructure development. It can stipulate civil strife, but also generate an increase in national security and strengthen property rights. Thus, the role of military expenditure is ambiguous and the direction of the overall effect remains an empirical question.\n\nGiven the historical and political context of Guatemala, however, it is hard to believe that military expenditure plays a positive role on economic growth. According to the Commission for Historical Clarification (1999) an overwhelming number of violent actions during the civil war was attributed to members of the army. In addition, forced displacement and mandatory civil defense patrols (Patrullas de Autodefensa Civil? PACs) diverted a significant share of the economically active population from productive activities. Guatemalan defense spending reached its height during the peak of the civil war and declined in the advent of the peace process. They eventually began to rise again in 2000. Even without econometric analysis, a look at Figure 7e reveals that output growth is essentially opposite to the ratio of military expenditure to GDP. Moreover, the negative correlation of the share of foreign capital goods to investment suggests that a higher ratio of military expenditure to GDP is associated with a decrease in the efficiency of capital accumulation. When military\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    29\n    As a share of GDP, military expenditure in Guatemala is not excessively high, ranging from 0.7 up to 2 percent. However, its share of government expenditures is quite significant. According to Scheetz (2000) it has varied from approximately 14 up to 31 percent (in the 1980s) in terms of total resources controlled by the Treasury.",

      "56": "expenditures are included into the regression, column 6 of Table 10 reveals a significant negative impact on long-run growth. The implicit elasticity suggests that a 1 percent increase in the defense burden decreases output by approximately 0.08 percent. Considering the negative correlation with imported capital goods ( $\\mathrm{r}=-0.69$ ) and the effects of the internal war, however, the true magnitude of military expenditures on long-run growth may be underestimated.\n\n# 6.4 Summing-Up \n\nFor the case of Guatemala, sensitive tests reveal that the relationship of human capital and growth proves stable. Parameter stability of the coefficients is acceptable and employing alternative data in fact strengthens the findings. An important aspect is that the health status of the country exhibits a strong impact on long-run growth. In the light of Guatemala's recent history, it does not come as a big surprise that military expenditure has hampered growth. One important point here is that it crowds out investment. By contrast, imported foreign capital goods exhibit a significant impact on long-run growth via an increase in the efficiency of capital accumulation. In agreement with the previous section, primary schooling has the strongest impact on productivity growth, and is particularly affected by adjustments for the quality of capital and the growth of trade openness.\n\n## 7. Sources of Growth\n\nThe following paragraphs apply a modified growth-accounting framework to explore some basic facts of economic growth in Guatemala. Growth accounting can be very informative by providing a consistent decomposition of economic growth among its proximate sources. As such, growth accounting is a useful framework to explain a country's growth experience and may provide a basis for medium-term recommendations. The section is divided into four parts. Section 7.1 briefly describes the methodological framework. To facilitate comparisons section 7.2 presents alternative measures of the sources of growth for Guatemala. After giving the results of a traditional Solow (1957) decomposition, indices for the quality of inputs are considered. Section 7.3 extends the basic growth accounting framework to disaggregate by 叔vel of education. Finally, section 7.4 compares the results with international evidence.\n\n### 7.1 Growth Accounting Framework\n\nGrowth accounting is a technique that seeks to identify the sources of economic growth. The standard aggregate production function that generates the growth accounting equation is:\n\n$$\nY_{t}=A_{t} \\cdot K_{t}^{\\alpha} \\cdot L_{t}^{(1-\\alpha)}\n$$",
      "57": "where $Y, K$ and $L$ represent output, physical capital stock and labor input, respectively. The term $A$ is total factor productivity (TFP) and reflects the relative efficiency of the inputs to produce a given amount of output. The production function is assumed to have constant returns to scale and the markets are assumed to be competitive. In this framework, the growth rate of output can be represented as:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta Y_{t}}{Y_{t-1}}=\\frac{\\Delta A_{t}}{A_{t-1}}+\\alpha \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta K_{t}}{K_{t-1}}+(1-\\alpha) \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta L_{t}}{L_{t-1}}\n$$\n\nwhere output growth is divided into components attributable to changes in the factors of production. TFP growth is a residual that represents the component of growth that is not explained by increases in the factors of production, but rather by productivity gains. The production function elasticities can give estimates of factor shares that are used to weigh the relative contribution of the inputs growth rates and to obtain straightforward estimates of the residual. Based on the results of the earlier regressions, the capital share, $\\alpha$, is taken to be equal to $1 / 3$. According to Bosworth et al. (1996) the econometric results are quite consistent with the evidence for other developing countries. Reliable estimates typically yield capital shares in the range of $0.3-0.4$.\n\nEstimates of Solow residuals are sensitive to the precision of the estimated factor shares, measurement errors, and adjustments for utilization and quality. For the case of Guatemala, as will be apparent in the next section, it is crucial to explicitly account for the quality of inputs. ${ }^{30}$ Within the basic framework, changes in the quality of labor and physical capital are picked up in TFP. As such, TFP growth is overstated and the contribution of inputs is understated. In order to explicitly account for changes in the quality of inputs, the standard sources of growth equation is extended:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta Y_{t}}{Y_{t-1}}=\\frac{\\Delta A_{t}}{A_{t-1}}+\\alpha \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\Delta K_{t}}{K_{t-1}}+\\frac{\\Delta z q_{t}}{z q_{t-1}}\\right)+(1-\\alpha) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{t}}{L_{t-1}}+\\frac{\\Delta h q_{t}}{h q_{t-1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $z q_{t}$ and $h q_{t}$ are quality indices of capital and labor, respectively.\nAnother important consideration, not captured by the basic framework, is to account for the contribution by level of education. Barro (1998) describes extensions of the basic growth accounting framework to allow for disaggregation across different factor types. Incorporating primary, secondary and tertiary education into the production function augmented for human capital gives:\n\n30 Accounting for the degree of utilization of factor inputs is equally important. A common proxy is to use the unemployment rate. However, in the case of Guatemala with its extremely poor data on unemployment, such an adjustment is more likely to introduce measurement error than to correct for it.",
      "58": "$$\n\\frac{\\Delta Y_{t}}{Y_{t-1}}=\\frac{\\Delta A_{t}}{A_{t-1}}+\\alpha \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\Delta K_{t}}{K_{t-1}}\\right)+\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\beta_{t} \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\Delta H_{t, i}}{H_{t, t-1}}\\right)+\\left(1-\\alpha-\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\beta_{t}\\right) \\cdot\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L_{t}}{L_{t-1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{i}$ indexes for primary, secondary and tertiary schooling. The capital share for physical capital is $1 / 3$. Likewise, the shares for human capital, $\\beta_{t}$, are taken from the earlier regression estimates disaggregated by level of education. To ensure comparability with the aggregate case, however, the coefficients are scaled so as to preserve the aggregate human capital share of approximately $1 / 3$. Consequently, the implicit shares for the aggregate case are 0.17 for primary, 0.11 for secondary and 0.05 for tertiary schooling.\n\nFinally, before taking a look at the results, it is important to emphasize some methodological caveats of growth accounting. TFP reflects a whole range of factors since it captures everything that is not accounted for. It is hard to distinguish the effect of technological change from that of improved resource allocation, or from bias resulting from model deficiencies and poor data quality. Thus, TFP estimates may be affected by scale economies and can be sensitive to data perpetuation.\n\nIn addition, findings in the area of growth accounting require careful interpretation because the technique does not provide information about the interdependencies of the variables. For instance, an increase of output growth could be due to a percentage change in educational attainment. This would not imply that, in the absence of educational improvements, the growth rate would have been precisely the same percentage point lower. Quite the contrary, education could impact on output growth due to fertility, attitudes and labor force participation, investment and productivity. Therefore, growth accounting should be treated with caution and only be regarded as a useful technique for examining growth.\n\n# 7.2 Sources of Growth in Traditional Framework \n\nTable 11 presents a basic decomposition of GDP growth for Guatemala for 19512002. TFP is measured as the residual representing the component of growth not explained by labor or capital accumulation. There are no adjustments for the quality of inputs. The results suggest that growth in Guatemala is largely due to the accumulation of inputs. Labor plays the dominant role in explaining about 50 percent of Guatemala's growth rate of GDP, followed by the accumulation of capital with approximately 32 percent. Growth of TFP? unadjusted for the quality of inputs? was about 18 percent.\n\nIntroducing quality change in factor inputs brings the relative roles of capital and labor into a sharper focus. Table 12 presents a decomposition of GDP growth for 1971-2002. Average annual growth was about 3.5 percent, while it was 3.9 percent during the whole five decades. Compared to the basic growth accounting framework, the results change dramatically. In particular, quality-adjusted labor now explains about 78 percent of the growth rate of GDP, compared to 50 percent explained by the",

      "60": "unadjusted labor variable. This finding unambiguously suggests that the effect of the increase of education, now captured by the labor quality index, was the main driving force behind TFP growth during the past decades.\n\nBy contrast, quality-adjusted capital only explains about 28 percent of growth, compared to 32 percent explained by the unadjusted variable. Consistent with earlier findings, the decrease of capital accumulation in explaining GDP growth reflects the deterioration of the quality of the country's physical capital base. This is most likely associated with the disastrous effect of the civil war and a negative investment climate, among other factors. The finding of a negative rate of TFP growth of about 6 percent for the period 1971-2002 is a somewhat odd result. Rather than 'technological regress' it should be interpreted as an indication of the declining efficiency of the economy, due to the conflicting political and social environment of the country. Notice that TFP growth is consistent with the earlier regression results. In most specifications the constant term was found to be significantly negative.\n\nHow stable are these findings? The TFP estimate was found sufficiently robust. A sensitivity analysis based on alternative assumptions on the factor shares yielded TFP growth estimates ranging from -4 percent (capital share 0.4 and labor share 0.6 ) to -1 percent (capital share 0.5 and labor share 0.5 ). The associated changes of the contribution of labor and capital was negligible. Applying alternative data sources to calculate the residual was not found to be helpful. The robustness tests of the regression analyses clearly indicate that both the labor (based on IGSS data) and capital variable ( 5 percent depreciation) provide a higher explanatory power than other sources.\n\n# 7.3 Disaggregation by Education Level \n\nTable 13 shows the results of the extended growth accounting exercise for the period 1951-2002. The human capital variables now enter directly into the production function by level of education. They capture improvements in the country's skill base, which were formerly measured by quality-adjusted labor. At first sight, the overall results are somewhat similar to the decomposition of GDP growth in the traditional framework. With about 32 percent explaining growth, the role of physical capital accumulation is moderate.\n\nAt second sight, the contrast to the traditional framework is apparent. Table 13 suggests that human resources are the main engine of growth. In fact, the human capital variables alone explain approximately 50 percent of output growth. Of these, the main contribution comes from secondary education with about 21 percent. This is closely followed by primary education, which explains about 19 percent of growth. The contribution of tertiary education was only 10 percent.\n\nInsofar, both primary and secondary schooling constitute major determinants of GDP growth. The fact that secondary education constitutes the dominant role reflects its rapid increase in the share of the economically active population. Approximately 20",

      "62": "percent of the labor force has had secondary schooling in 2000, compared to only about 2 percent in 1950. The increase of primary schooling in the labor over time was much slower. As evidenced on Table 3, during the past five decades it has essentially doubled. Finally, Table 14 presents a decomposition of GDP growth by level of education. Capital is here adjusted for quality. Notice that the quantitative results for the period 1971-2002 are almost identical to Table 12. Capital explains 28 percent of growth, compared to 78 percent explained by labor and education. Of these, secondary education plays the dominant role, followed by primary and tertiary education. Thus, the results of the different accounting exercise were found consistent over time.\n\nFigure 8. Guatemala: Evolution of Total Factor Productivity, 1951-2002 (annual growth rates, in percent)\n![img-12.jpeg](img-12.jpeg)\n\nSource: Author's calculations.\nFigure 8 plots the annual TFP growth rates for the period 1951-2002. It contains two measures of TFP. The dotted line indicates TFP growth adjusted for the quality of labor. The thin solid line presents TFP growth adjusted for the quality of capital and labor. Both lines show similar patterns. Productivity growth is volatile according to Figure 8. Also, it is apparently not free of measurement errors. For instance, the strong increase in 1981 is probably best interpreted by data deficiencies. Therefore, to facilitate the interpretation of the results, the bold trend line was included using the Hodrick-Prescott filter. Productivity growth has been positive, although slightly decreasing until the late 1950s. This was followed by a substantial deterioration from the early 1960 until the end of the 1980s. In the 1990s, TFP growth became positive",
      "63": "again, but from 1999 on has eventually decreased. ${ }^{31}$ All in all, Figure 8 obviously suggests that TFP growth in Guatemala was closely associated with political events.\n\n# 7.4 Comparison of Results with International Evidence \n\nHow do these estimates compare to other Latin American countries? The Appendix summarizes the results of a study that applies a comparable methodology. Loayza et al. (2002) focus on the growth performance of 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries. Similar to the approach used here, they adjust for changes in the quality of labor associated with increased educational attainment. ${ }^{32}$ Consistent with international evidence, Loayza et al. find that during the 1990s the recovery in output growth for the 'best' performers in the Latin American region was driven by increases in their rates of TFP growth, and less so by factor accumulation.\n\nHowever, in most Central American countries TFP growth was only moderate. In some cases it was even negative. While TFP growth in Guatemala appears to be on the high side compared to its Central American neighbors, it is worth recalling that the estimate presented in the Appendix does not take into account quality changes of the physical capital stock. Given the decay of Guatemala's quality-adjusted capital stock, TFP growth is likely to be overstated. In addition, a one-to-one comparison is hampered by the nature of the different data sources. ${ }^{33}$ Overall, Guatemala's growth experience shows some similarities with its neighbors, in particular with Costa Rica and El Salvador. During the 1990s these countries have experienced much faster growth than during the 1980s. In particular, quality-adjusted bbor - associated with increased educational attainment - was the main source of growth.\n\n## 8. Conclusion\n\nHuman capital has a highly significant and positive impact on long-run growth in Guatemala. The importance of human capital is substantial. An increase by 1 percentage point of average years of schooling would raise output by about 0.33 percent. The effect is of similar magnitude to that in micro studies. A disaggregated analysis by level of education reveals that primary schooling is most important for productivity growth, followed by secondary schooling. Over the past decades, it appears that general education and basic technical skills have been the main\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    31 This finding is in agreement with other recent growth accounting studies for Guatemala, which are presented in Box 3.\n\n    32\n    Roldós (1997) examines the growth experience for Chile, and adjusts for changes in the quality of labor and capital. These results are in the Appendix.\n\n    33\n    For example, Loayza et al. (2002) rely on the Barro and Lee (2001) data set on educational attainment.",
      "64": "determinants for the diffusion of technological innovations, and people with primary education have particularly benefited from policies that promote competitiveness, such as trade openness. The stability of the error-correction model with respect to data issues and endogeneity concerns are the main reasons for confidence in the overall results. The robustness is even more remarkable in the context of heavy distortions within the Guatemalan economy.\n\nAccounting for the sources of growth supports the importance of human capital in Guatemala. Such an exercise reveals that the increased skill level has been the main driving force behind productivity growth, and that education explains more than 50 percent of output growth during the past five decades. A differentiation by level of education suggests that the growth of secondary schooling was the predominant factor, closely followed by primary education. Tertiary education ranks last. Due to an environment of social and political conflict, however, total factor productivity has been slightly negative over the past decades. The evolution of productivity growth is linked to political events - such as the civil strife and military rule - and suggests a declining efficiency of the economy over time.\n\nThe study contains additional findings of interest, which ultimately point towards the importance of an institutional and political environment conducive to growth. They can be summarized as follows:\n\nFirst, Guatemala's growth process was accompanied by the exclusion of large parts of society from wealth and by underlying social conflict. The growth rates of the sectors that employ the poor and rural people lagged behind other sectors of the economy. Extreme social imbalances and weak institutions for conflict management gave rise to an internal military conflict that imposed high costs for long-run growth. Regarding Guatemala's future growth prospects, a key factor for reducing the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks is to reduce inequality and to strengthen democratic institutions.\n\nSecond, mean education of the labor force has increased over time, although it suffered from the civil strife. The attention to education since the Peace Accords has only compensated the loss of human capital caused by the civil war, but does not represent a major improvement regarding the long-run growth of human capital. This means that considerably more effort is needed to strengthen the country's human capital base. The strong impact of life expectancy on growth suggests that human capital policies should not only focus on the expansion of the quantity as well as the quality of primary and secondary education, but in particular also place a great deal of emphasis on the health status of the population.\n\nFinally, there is evidence of a missing complementarity between Guatemala's skills and its technology base. That is, for the period 1970-2002 the quality of Guatemala's physical capital stock decreased by about 20 percent. Prominent explanations for this decline are the destructive impact of the civil war, and a negative investment climate due to an unstable policy environment and a lack of good governance. The apparent",
      "65": "gap between the evolution of quality of labor and physical capital could be a key factor for decreased output growth during the past decades. Decreased efficiency in capital accumulation also tends to reduce the returns to education, in particular for primary schooling. Hence, measures to stimulate investment and imports of foreign capital goods - for example by reducing trade distortions and improving the investment climate - are important complementary factors to human capital policies.",

      "3": "# 1. Introduction \n\nIn the last four decades, the volatility of commodity prices generated turbulence in the global economy, affecting importing and exporting countries in opposite and vigorous ways. Nonetheless, the attention of the literature to the topic seemed to be proportional to price growth, declining in relatively tranquil periods and rising when the commodities prices were back at high levels. The huge variations of the last decade generated a renewed interest in the topic.\n\nIn the 1970s, the popular view was that commodity prices were defined as a result of evolution in the relevant commodity market, playing an important role in the stagflation of that decade. However, this idea has been strongly challenged. An increase in the expected inflation rate due, for example, to an increase in money supply, causes agents to shift from money to commodities, provoking a rise in prices. Therefore, increases in the price of oil and other commodities could be the result of an exceedingly expansionary policy, rather than an exogenous inflationary supply shock.\n\nFalling commodity prices in the 1980s and 1990s were not considered as interesting as rising prices, even though oil producers such as Mexico and Russia were experiencing important revenue losses and countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Australia were suffering from low agricultural prices.\n\nAfter collapsing in the second half of 2008, commodity prices stabilized in early 2009 and subsequently staged a comeback. Such behavior is in contrast with what happened during past recessions. In previous global downturns, prices typically continued to fall into the early phases of recovery or rose at rates far below the increases recorded in recent months. An exception is the price of oil, which recorded meaningful increases early in previous recoveries.\n\nThus, the recent happenings of quick commodity price increases and higher volatility following the easy monetary stance in the US, matched with similar accommodative policies in the euro area and Japan, led some to infer some causal role for monetary changes in driving commodity prices and ultimately inflation.\n\nDrawing on Dornbusch (1976), the idea of overshooting has been adapted to analyze theoretically the relationship between money, consumer prices and commodity prices by Frankel (1986). The latter argued that tightening monetary policy has relevant effects on commodity prices because they are flexible, whereas other goods' prices are sticky. Thus, commodity prices overshoot their new equilibrium in the short-run in order to generate an expectation of future appreciation sufficient to offset the higher interest rate.\n\nThis paper aims at identifying the nexus between the excess of liquidity in the United States and commodity prices over the 1983-2006 period. In particular, it tests whether the latter react more powerfully than consumer goods' prices to changes in real money balances.\n\nWithin a cointegrated vector autoregressive (VAR) framework, it is investigated whether consumer prices and commodity prices react to excess liquidity in the US, and if the different price elasticities of supply for goods and commodities allow for differences in the dynamic paths of price adjustment to a liquidity shock.\n\nThe results show a positive relationship between real money and real commodity prices and provide empirical evidence for a stronger response of commodity prices with respect to consumer goods' prices. This could imply that, if the magnitude of the reaction is due to the fact that consumer goods' prices are slower to react, then their long-run value can be predicted with the help of the commodity prices.\n\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In section 2, some contributions on the issue are presented. Section 3 describes the hypothesis to be tested. In section 4 the empirical strategy, tests results and interpretation of the findings are presented. Section 5 ends the paper reporting the conclusions.",
      "4": "# 2. A review of the literature \n\nBefore discussing the empirical analysis employed, some of the main contributions on the relationship between monetary policy, consumer prices and commodity prices will be reviewed.\n\nDrawing on Dornbusch's exchange rate overshooting model, Frankel (1986) provides a theoretical framework to analyze the impact of money supply shocks on commodity prices. He substitutes the price of agricultural goods for the price of foreign exchange and argues that the reason for the overshooting phenomenon is that prices for agricultural and mineral products adjust rapidly, while the price of goods adjusts more slowly. In fact, the hypothesis is that commodities are exchanged in a reactive auction market in which the supply cannot be easily expanded, whereas the consumer goods market enjoys a copious supply.\n\nFrankel illustrates the dynamic starting from a monetary contraction that is expected to be permanent and that would eventually lead to an equal fall of consumer and commodity goods' prices in the absence of other disturbances. However, given the manufactured price stickiness in the short-run the nominal money supply contraction is a reduction in the real money supply. Such a reduction should be offset by an interest rate rise. Nevertheless, the arbitrage condition implies that, since commodities are storable, the interest rate cannot grow more than the expected rate of increase in the commodity prices plus the storage cost. Therefore, the spot price of commodities must fall today and must do so until the moment in which there is an expectation of future appreciation that is sufficient to offset the higher interest rate.\n\nOver the last three decades the role of commodity prices in setting monetary policy has been faced by many researchers. On the one hand, it has been argued that commodity prices may be an earlier indicator of the current state of the economy because, as assumed by Frenkel (1986) these prices are usually set in continuous auction markets with efficient information (see Olivera, 1970; Garner, 1989; Marquis and Cunningham, 1990; Cody and Mills, 1991). Thus, some policymakers became advocates of using commodity prices as a leading indicator of inflation and endorsed policy proposals using commodity prices as a guide to adjust short run money growth target ranges (see Garner, 1989). A rise in commodity prices may indicate to policymakers that the economy is growing too rapidly and hence inflation is inclined to rise. In such a case, the monetary authority may observe the rising commodity prices and respond by raising interest rates to tighten money supply.\n\nOn the other hand, the counterargument is that commodity prices cannot be used effectively in formulating monetary policy because they are subject to large, market-specific shocks, which may not have macroeconomic implications (see Marquis and Cunningham, 1990; Cody and Mills, 1991). However, many others (see Bessler, 1984; Pindyck and Rotemberg, 1990; Hua, 1998) argue that commodity price movements are the result of monetary or macroeconomic changes and that the causality should run from macroeconomic/monetary variables to commodity prices. Barsky and Kilian (2002) offer another important contribution. They argue that monetary expansions and contractions could generate stagflation of important magnitudes, by providing evidence about the role of monetary fluctuations in determining the prices of oil and, in particular, the prices of industrial commodities that preceded the 1973 oil price increase. Bernanke et al. (1997) investigate the relationship between the oil price shocks, US monetary policy and the business cycle. They assert that a relevant part of the effect of oil price shocks on the economy comes from tighter monetary policy resulting from the change in oil prices and not from the change in oil prices per se.",
      "5": "Another piece of literature analyzes the impact of the commodity price evolutions on the behavior of monetary policy and its informational role for formulating it. Awokuse and Yang (2003) argue that commodity price indicators contain important information about the future movements of macroeconomic variables. Bhar and Hamori (2008) assess the information content of commodity prices for monetary policy. Using a cross correlation approach between economic activity and commodity futures prices, they affirm that commodity prices can serve as suitable information for monetary policy.\n\nFuhrer and Moore (1992) investigate the relationships between asset prices and inflation in a Keynesian model in which monetary policy controls inflation by manipulating the federal funds rate. They find that the indicator properties of asset prices are quite sensitive to the monetary policy rule. Hamori (2007) empirically analyzes the relationship between the commodity prices index and macroeconomic variables in Japan, arguing that the former and the general price level are closely related, with movements in commodity prices leading movements in the general price level. However, he specifies that the commodity price index was found to be valid as a leading indicator of the consumer price index before the zero interest policy was introduced, as afterwards the relationship ceased to exist.\n\nOther studies, such as Surrey (1989), Boughton and Branson (1990, 1991), and Browne and Cronin (2007), investigate empirically the potential importance of monetary conditions on the relationship between commodity prices and consumer goods' prices. However, they all use different empirical techniques or different specifications from the one employed in this paper.\n\n# 3. A Model of Price Dynamics \n\nThis section presents the theoretical framework through which the investigation aims to answer the following research question: do commodity prices react more strongly than consumer goods' prices?\n\nAs mentioned, the commodity price overshooting theory was advanced by Frankel (1986). The essence of this theoretical framework is that the short-term reaction to an expansionary monetary policy produces an overshoot of the commodity prices and a more delayed reaction in the consumer goods market. In the long-run, consumer prices adjust to the new equilibrium. However, Frenkel's theory is fundamentally based on the assumption that commodity prices react more strongly in the short-run than the consumer goods' prices.\n\nIn order to test the hypothesis it is allowed for a two-good economy, and commodities and consumer goods with prices $p^{C O M}$ and $p^{C P I}$, respectively. The substantial difference between these two goods is that consumer prices are decided in a market with a supply that adjusts to the changes in demand, while the commodity prices are decided in a market restricted in supply and with high transaction costs, due to transportation expenses. Therefore, consumer goods' prices are sticky, whereas commodity prices are not.\n\nThe rationale for this assumption can be found in the current scenario where many low-cost producers (especially in developing countries) are generating additional supply of consumer goods, while commodity supply is constrained by natural factors. Furthermore, the speed of the adjustment depends on the fact that participants in the commodity markets are usually more equally informed than their consumer goods' counterparts.\n\nGraphically, the two markets can be represented as in Figure 1.\n[Figure 1 about here]",
      "6": "Figure 1 shows the price-quantity changes as a result of a monetary expansion in markets with high (left graph) and low (right graph) price elasticity of supply. The aggregated supply of price elastic goods in the short-run is characterized by infinite price elasticity so that additional demand brought about by a liquidity shock (from D to $\\mathrm{D}^{\\prime}$ ) can be satisfied without any price increase. Consequently, the liquidity shock translates into an increase in output achieving a new short-run equilibrium at $p^{C P I}$. In contrast, goods characterized by restrictions in supply, cannot be expanded easily and are thus quantity-insensitive to a monetary expansion. Additional demand is then fully reflected in a rise in commodity prices.\n\nIn the long-run, prices will also react on the price elastic goods market if the welldocumented neutrality of money holds; any change in money supply is met with a proportional change in the price level that keeps real money and real output in both markets unchanged.\n\nMore formally, the general price level is:\n\n$$\np=\\lambda p^{C O M}+(1-\\lambda) p^{C P I}, 0<\\lambda<1\n$$\n\nA once-off increase of $\\mu$ percent in the money supply in period $t$ produces an increase in the general price level by $\\left(1+\\mu_{t}\\right) p_{t-1}$. However, given the initial assumption, such increase fully translates into the commodity price $p^{C O M}$, because $p^{C P I}$ is sticky. Thus, the price relationship at time $t$ will be:\n\n$$\np_{t}=\\lambda p_{t}^{C O M}+(1-\\lambda) p_{t-1}^{C P I}\n$$\n\nAssuming no further changes in the money supply in period $t+1$, the general level of prices at time $t+1$ will be the same as in $t$.\n\n$$\np_{t+1}=\\lambda p_{t+1}^{C O M}+(1-\\lambda) p_{t+1}^{C P I}\n$$\n\nThis allows setting the right hand side of Equation 2 to be equal to the right end side of Equation 3.\n\n$$\n\\lambda p_{t}^{C O M}+(1-\\lambda) p_{t-1}^{C P I}=\\lambda p_{t+1}^{C O M}+(1-\\lambda) p_{t+1}^{C P I}\n$$\n\nAs $p_{t-1}^{C P I}=p_{t}^{C P I}$ and $p_{t+1}^{C O M}=\\left(1+\\mu_{t}\\right) p_{t-1}^{C O M}$, after some algebra the following equation is obtained:\n\n$$\np_{t+1}^{C P I}-p_{t}^{C P I}=[\\lambda(1-\\lambda)]\\left[p_{t}^{C O M}-\\left(1+\\mu_{t}\\right) p_{t-1}^{C O M}\\right]\n$$\n\nThe different dynamics of the adjustment processes implies that the size of the change of the consumer goods' prices in period $t$ can be predicted by observing the spread between the current period price of the commodities $\\left(p_{t}^{C O M}\\right)$ and the equilibrium value to which it must adjust in period $t+1,\\left(\\left(1+\\mu_{t}\\right) p_{t-1}^{C O M}\\right)$, which is dependent on the monetary shock in the current period $\\left(\\mu_{t}\\right)$.\n\n# 4. Empirical Analysis \n\nFirst, this section documents the strategy chosen for the analysis and the data used and describes the empirical analysis. Secondly, the results from the estimation of the model are presented and discussed.",
      "7": "# 4.1. Empirical Strategy \n\nThe analysis is carried out using a cointegrated VAR model. Formally the model is six dimensional VAR with independent and identically-distributed Gaussian errors:\n\n$$\nX_{t}=\\mathrm{A}_{1} X_{t-1}+\\cdots+\\mathrm{A}_{k} X_{t-k}+\\Phi D_{t}+\\varepsilon_{t}, t=1, \\ldots T\n$$\n\nwhere $X_{t}$ is the following vector of variables:\n\n$$\nX_{t}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\ny^{r} \\\\\nm^{r} \\\\\ni_{m} \\\\\ni_{b} \\\\\n\\Delta P \\\\\nC R B-C P I\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNamely real output, real money, short term and long term interest rates, inflation and real commodity prices, and $D_{t}$ is a vector of deterministic components.\n\nThe Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) representation of the VAR model combines levels and differences as follows:\n\n$$\nX_{t}=\\Pi X_{t-1}+\\Gamma_{1} \\Delta X_{t-1}+\\cdots+\\Gamma_{k-1} \\Delta X_{t-k-1}+\\Phi D_{t}+\\varepsilon_{t}, t=1, \\ldots T\n$$\n\nwhere $\\Pi$ are the effects in the long-run and $\\Gamma_{1}$ contains the short-run information. The inconsistency with the $X_{t}$ integrated of order one is solved by transforming the multivariate model and reducing the rank of $\\Pi$ to $r<p$ with $p$ being the number of variables. The reduced rank matrix can be factorized into two $r x p$ matrices $\\alpha$ and $\\beta\\left(\\Pi=\\alpha \\beta^{\\prime}\\right)$. The factorization provides $r$ stationary linear combinations of the variables called cointegrating vectors, and $p-r$ common stochastic trends of the system.\n\nWithin a cointegrated VAR framework, the common shocks, or common stochastic trends, are hitting all the variables simultaneously. Since an impulse response analysis implies assuming a certain structure of shocks, namely that one variable is exclusively hitting the variable we are interested in, this has been neglected as such assumption cannot be tested (see Juselius, 2006).\n\n### 4.2. Data and Unit Root Tests\n\nThe choice of the country has to do with the fact that, even if the US accounts for less than one-third of world GDP, its importance in the monetary and financial system is evidently higher than that. The period under analysis goes from the first quarter of 1983, to the first quarter of 2008. Such span corresponds to a fairly stable period in terms of inflation growth.\n\nAs an indicator of the nominal money supply, data on the M2 aggregate have been downloaded from the International Financial Statistics (IFS) dataset, as well as data on nominal gross domestic product (GDP), consumer price index (CPI), 3-month Treasury bill rate and 10-years government bond yield. As a proxy for the commodity prices the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) index has been adopted. This index measures the combined movements in the prices of 22 basic commodities whose markets are assumed to be among the first to be influenced by changes in economic conditions and therefore by the monetary policy.",
      "8": "In order to perform an I(1) analysis, a nominal to real transformation has been performed. Since nominal GDP and nominal money supply show clear features of I(2) processes, they have been considered in real terms. Likewise, some transformations have been done on price indexes. On the one hand, inflation has been considered instead of the CPI index (typically I(2)); on the other hand, the difference between the CRB index and the CPI index has been taken (real commodity prices hereafter).\n\nReal money, real GDP, inflation and real commodity prices have been taken in logs. The interest rates have been transformed into quarterly rates. Table 1 presents some descriptive statistics of the variables considered ${ }^{2}$.\n[Table1 about here]\n\nThe unit root properties of the series are tentatively investigated using two unit root tests. The first unit root test performed is the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, for which stationarity serves as the null hypothesis. However, it should be noted that the ADF test could fail to distinguish between a unit root and a near unit root process and it can happen that indicates that a series contains a unit root when it does not (Perron 1989). Thus, a second unit root test is adopted, namely the Kwiatkowsk, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin (KPSS) test, for which the null hypothesis is non-stationarity.\n[Table 2 about here]\n\nAs shown in Table 2, the results from both the tests employed confirm that all the variables in the system are integrated of order one at $5 \\%$ significance level. Nonetheless, it should be remembered that such tests are not reliable in the presence of breaks or shifts in the series.\n\nFigure 2 and 3 show the graphs of the series in levels and first differences.\n[Figure 2 about here]\n[Figure 3 about here]\n\nA graphical inspection of the data reveals that the assumption of constant mean does not seem appropriate for the level of the variables, whereas it does much more so for the differenced series. The assumption of constant variance seems to be approximately satisfied for the differences, even though some variability can be observed in most of the series. In order to account for the biggest departures from assumptions, three permanent blip dummies have been added to the model in correspondence of the biggest residuals. The first one takes the value one during the fourth quarter of 1984, when Ronald Reagan was re-elected as President of the US. The second one controls for the dramatic slump in inflation during the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Note that for both the CPI and CRB index the value 100 is given to the first quarter of 1983.",
      "9": "second quarter of 2006, probably due to an unexpected plunge in energy prices. The last dummy controls for the economic impacts of the terrorists attack of September 11, 2001.\n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that the graph of the real money shows two breaks in trend. A constant increase in the variable is observed from the beginning of the sample until 1987. A period of approximately zero growth follows and lasts until 1995, when it starts increasing as fast as in the first period. Thus, the slope of the two growing trends seems to be roughly the same. Even though the introduction of two breaks has been attempted, it turned out more satisfactory to allow for trends in the levels. This should have the effect of averaging out the aforementioned breaks. Moreover, since it is not possible to know a priori whether these trends cancel out in the cointegrating relations, the chosen specification allows these to be trend-stationary and have non-zero intercepts.\n\n# 4.3. Lag Length Selection and Residual Analysis \n\nTable 3 shows that the Schwartz criterion (SC) suggests $k=1$ and the Hannan-Quinn $(\\mathrm{HQ})$ criterion suggests $k=2$. However, when imposing $k=1$ the other misspecifications tests become much worse, implying that the SC might have penalized too much. The LM tests in the last two columns show the left-over residual autocorrelation in each $\\operatorname{VAR}(k)$ model and seem to accept the absence of autocorrelation for the VAR with 2 lags.\n[Table 3 about here]\n\nTable 4 presents the results of the multivariate residual analysis. In particular the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation is rejected at both the first and the second lag. Given the relatively small sample, it is not advisable to rely on the asymptotic properties of the estimator, thus the normality assumption turns out to be relevant and it is safely accepted. Lastly the null hypothesis of no ARCH effects is accepted at both lags.\n[Table 4 about here]\n\nTable 5 shows the results of the univariate residual analysis. The output of the ARCH and Normality tests reflect the good results of the multivariate analysis. The skewness and kurtosis statistics are close to the normal distribution values, suggesting that by inserting the three blip dummies the biggest outliers should have been controlled for.\n[Table 5 about here]\n\nOverall, both the multivariate and univariate tests suggest that the residuals are well behaved and therefore that the model is well specified.\n\n### 4.4. Rank Determination\n\nThe cointegration rank is determined according to Johansen (1996) LR Trace test. When the sample is small, the asymptotic distributions are generally poor approximations to the true distributions. To secure a correct test size one can apply the small sample Bartlett",
      "10": "corrections developed in Johansen (2002). The asymptotic distribution of the rank test statistic differs depending on the deterministic components in the model and on almost any type of dummy variable ${ }^{3}$. Therefore, the safest procedure is to simulate the new critical values. Table 6 presents the Trace test results with the Bartlett corrections and the simulated critical values.\n[Table 6 about here]\n\nThe choice of the cointegration rank is not clearly defined, in fact the Trace test Bartlett corrected suggests that $r=3$ is accepted only at $10 \\%$ significance level. Looking at the significance of the $\\alpha$ coefficients of the third cointegration vector in Table 7 it seems that information regarding the real GDP and the real commodity prices would be neglected by choosing $r=2$.\n[Table 7 about here]\n\nA graphical inspection of the cointegrating relations in Figure 4 reveals some symptom of I(2)ness. The first two cointegration relationships look fairly stationary, but the third one presents some indication of cyclical swings. However, it should be observed that the lower panel $\\left(\\beta_{r}^{\\prime} R_{1 \\mathrm{r}}\\right)$ corrected for short-run effects of each graph is similar to the upper panel $\\left(\\beta_{r}^{\\prime} x_{\\mathrm{r}}\\right)$, confirming that the $\\mathrm{I}(2)$ problem could have been limited (see appendix for a formal $\\mathrm{I}(2)$ rank test).\n[Figure 4 about here]\n\nMoreover, an examination of the characteristic roots shows that the largest unrestricted root for $r=2$ is 0.90 and for $r=3$ is 0.78 (pretty far from the unit circle). This seems to confirm the presence of three common stochastic trends. Figure 5 shows the roots of the companion matrix for $r=3$.\n[Figure 5 about here]\n\n# 4.5. Recursive Tests \n\nThe graphs of the recursively calculated fluctuation tests in Figure 6 show that the X form of $\\hat{\\tau}_{1}$ and $\\hat{\\tau}_{3}$ are in the rejection region at the beginning of 1995 , when the recursion starts. The test statistics remain at a fairly high level until approximately 1998. The recursive graphs of the $\\hat{\\tau}_{2}$ suggest that the parameter of the second cointegration relation are considerably constant over the sample period. The overall test in the lower right-hand side\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ An exception to this are the centered seasonal dummies, which, by construction, sum to zero over time, and hence do not change the asymptotic distribution of the rank tests.",
      "11": "panel picks up the non-constancy at the beginning of the recursions. However, it should be noted that the R-form looks stable in all $\\#$, meaning that the instability is only in the short-run coefficients. In general, the eigenvalue fluctuation tests provide a fair picture.\n[Figure 6 about here]\n\nThe Max test of $\\beta$ Constancy is always lower than one and shows a slightly higher volatility after 2003. Figure 7 confirms what is suggested by the eigenvalue fluctuation tests, namely that the changes in the eigenvalues are due to changes in $\\alpha$.\n[Table 7 about here]\n\n# 4.6. Long-Run Exclusion \n\nThe $\\Pi$ matrix gives tentative evidence of long-run exclusion for the variables in the system. If a variable is excludable, the coefficients in the columns must be insignificant. From the PI matrix there are no clear signs that any of the variables can be excluded from the cointegration relations.\n\nA formal LR-test for variable exclusion has been performed. Based on the results in Table 8, it is not possible to exclude any variable at $10 \\%$ significance level for $r=3$. However, the real commodity prices seem to be a border-line case.\n[Table 8 about here]\n\n### 4.7. Weak Exogeneity and Pure Adjustment\n\nThe $\\Pi$ matrix gives preliminary evidence of weak exogeneity. If a variable is weakly exogenous, the coefficients in the rows must be insignificant; in other words, it represents a pushing force. The only variable that seems not to react to any other variables is the real money.\n\nThe formal LR-test for weak exogeneity in Table 9 shows that both real GDP and real money are weakly exogenous at $10 \\%$ significance level, even though the joint exogeneity is rejected. It has been decided to carry out the analysis including them in the system in order to analyze their impact in the $\\Gamma$ matrix.\n[Table 9 about here]\n\nAnother LR-test is carried out to test for unit vector in the $\\alpha$ matrix. In other words, it tests whether the cumulated disturbances from the $\\mathrm{i}^{\\text {th }}$ variable do not enter the common trends (pure adjustment hypothesis). At $10 \\%$ significance level Table 10 shows that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected for the long term interest rate and the real commodity prices. Thus, these can be considered pulling forces.",
      "12": "# 4.8. Identification and Interpretation of the Results \n\nThe identifications process starts from the long-run relationships. It is carried out by imposing $r-1$ non-testable ${ }^{4}$ just-identifying restrictions on each beta vector of the unrestricted reduced VAR model with rank $r=3$, with no changes to the likelihood function with respect to the under identified model. Table 11 presents the estimation results that seem to suggest that the first beta vector is describing a money demand relationship with an unconventional sign on the inflation variable. The second cointegrating relationship illustrates the expected correlation between real output, real money, real commodity prices and a trend. Finally, the third stationary vector is expressing a relationship between inflation and the interest rate spread.\n[Table 11 about here]\n\nThe over-identified structure is modeled imposing restrictions accordingly to the t value of the $\\beta$ vectors' coefficients of the just-identified structure. This is accepted with a fairly large p-value of 0.642 (meaning that the stationarity of the long-run relations cannot be jointly rejected).\n\nTable 12 permits the detection of the pulling forces for each cointegration relation. The money demand relationship is corrected by changes in inflation, whereas the real commodity prices are the only equilibrium correcting force for the second cointegrating relation. Lastly, deviations from the inflation expectations relationship are corrected by inflation itself.\n[Table 12 about here]\n\nThe short-run identification has been carried out by removing all the non-significant variables from each equation of the cointegrated VAR ${ }^{5}$. The parsimonious structure cannot be rejected with a p-value of 0.257 and is broadly consistent with the classification into pushing and pulling forces ${ }^{6}$.\n\nThe equation for the interesting variable is reported in Table 13.\n[Table 13 about here]\n\nFrom the inspection of the $\\Omega$ matrix in Table 14, it is evident that some residuals are highly correlated (positively between real GDP and real money, negatively between inflation\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Since we have imposed $r-1$ restrictions, there are zero degrees of freedom, thus restrictions cannot be tested.\n    ${ }^{5}$ Centered seasonal dummies have been left in the equations for each variable, even if insignificant.\n    ${ }^{6}$ The equilibrium correcting role of the real commodity prices for the second cointegrating relationship confirmed.",
      "13": "and real GDP, negatively between inflation and real money and positively between the two interest rates) and this would suggest a simultaneous specification of the model. Nonetheless, such analysis has not been pursued because of the problems in determining the direction of the causation between the mentioned variables.\n[Table 14 about here]\n\nOverall, the results confirm the existence of the hypothesized long-run equilibrium relationship between real money and real commodity prices, with an effect from real output. Moreover, there is evidence that the real commodity prices are the only equilibrium correcting variable.\n\nIt can be concluded that in order to restore the long-run equilibrium when there is a real excess (lack) of liquidity, the real commodity prices need to increase (decrease). Such increase (decrease) can be achieved through an increase (decrease) in the commodity prices stronger (smaller) than the increase (decrease) in the consumer goods' prices, generating a larger spread between the two as in Figure 8.\n[Figure 8 about here]\n\nThe Moving Average (MA) representation of the data for $r=3$ corresponds to $p-r=3$ common trends. Since $p-r-1=2$ just-identifying restrictions are imposed on each vector, estimates are not unique and the likelihood function is unchanged. However, the space spanned by $\\alpha_{\\perp}$ and $\\beta_{\\perp}$ is uniquely determined, so that the estimated long-run impact matrix C is unique ${ }^{7}$. The normalization has been placed on the variables with the highest residual standard errors, namely real GDP, real money and real commodity prices.\n\nThe cumulated empirical shocks to the real GDP have had significant and high negative effects on the real commodity prices. The inverse is true, but the impact is much more moderate. The cumulated shocks to real money have had positive effects on inflation, as well as the cumulated shocks to short-term interest rate on long-term term one and vice versa. Moreover, the cumulated shocks to long term interest rate have had positive effects on inflation. Likewise, the cumulated shocks to inflation have had similar positive effects on both the interest rates. Finally, the cumulated shocks to all the variables have had a positive effect on themselves. It seems that the long-term interest rate is purely adjusting (consistently to the previous findings).\n\nIn order to impose the over-identifying restrictions on $\\alpha$, joint weak exogeneity for real money and real GDP is tested keeping fixed the restrictions on the $\\beta$ vectors. Since the hypothesis turns out to be rejected at $10 \\%$ significance level, a zero row in $\\alpha$ is imposed only for the real money, for which the null hypothesis cannot be rejected with a p-value of 0.505 . The C matrix of the over-identified MA representation is broadly consistent with the results obtained for the just-identified structure.\n\nAs a robustness check, the CRB has been replaced with the Conference Board's Sensitive Materials Index (SENSI). This comprises raw materials and metals but excludes food and energy. The results remain broadly the same as before.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ As when imposing just-identifying restrictions on the cointegrating relationships, the PI matrix was uniquely determined, albeit $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ vectors were not.",
      "14": "# 5. Conclusions \n\nCommodity prices are currently seen as one or the main source of current inflationary pressures and there seems to exist, as discussed by Frenkel (2006), a linkage between increases in commodity prices in commodity exporting countries and monetary policy changes in advanced industrial economies. This, as suggested, would defy the common knowledge that changes in commodity prices are solely impacted by developments occurring in the commodity markets.\n\nThe aim of the paper is to identify the nexus between the excess of liquidity in the US and commodity prices over the period 1983-2006 within a cointegrated VAR framework and in particular at testing whether the commodity prices react more powerfully than the consumer goods' prices to changes in real money balances.\n\nThe results provide empirical evidence on the magnitude of the reaction of commodity and consumer goods' prices to an increase in real money. In particular, a long-run equilibrium relationship between real money and real commodity prices has been found, with an effect from real output. The two variables of interest show positive and significant correlation.\n\nMoreover, real money seems to be a weakly exogenous variable and therefore is a pushing force (away from the equilibrium), whereas real commodity prices are the only equilibrium correcting variable to such cointegration relationship, or pulling force.\n\nTherefore, in order to restore the long-run equilibrium when there is a real excess (lack) of liquidity, the real commodity prices need to increase (decrease). Such increase (decrease) can be achieved through an increase (decrease) in the commodity prices stronger (smaller) than the increase (decrease) in the consumer goods' prices, generating a larger spread between the two.\n\nThe results have important policy implications. More specifically, if the magnitude of the reaction is due to the fact that consumer goods' prices are slower to react, then their longrun value can be predicted with the help of the commodity prices. In other words, the extent of the rise in the commodity prices acts to predict subsequent changes in the price of the other goods, namely the consumer goods, whose price is initially unchanged.\n\nMoreover, the results also support the idea that monetary policy cannot only focus on the core CPI and ignore developments in the commodity market. In fact, if commodity prices are very high it might be the case that monetary policy is loose; therefore they should be taken into account as a useful monetary indicator. This conclusion is particularly relevant to those countries that are adopting an inflation targeting regime which target is the CPI.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nI wish to thank Katarina Juselius, Morten Tabor and Paolo Paruolo for their kind support in carrying out the econometric analysis.

      "16": "# Appendix \n\nThe rank test for the $\\mathrm{I}(2)$ system has been performed for the system of variables $\\left(X_{t}\\right)$ used in the analysis. The result is border-line as the hypothesis $\\mathrm{H}(3,2,1)$ cannot be rejected with a p-value of 0.105 . Therefore, the system might present rank equal to three, two $\\mathrm{I}(1)$ trends and one $\\mathrm{I}(2)$ trends.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the estimates obtained are consistent even when there are $\\mathrm{I}(2)$ trends and that the standard tests (except the $\\mathrm{I}(1)$ trace test) are still valid.\n[Table A about here]",

      "1": "# Abstract \n\nHow redistributive are fiscal policies in China? This paper applies the standard fiscal incidence analysis to data from the China Family Panel Study 2018 to study the effect of government taxes and spending on inequality in China. The analysis includes fiscal elements, such as personal income tax, contributions to social insurance, value-added tax, consumption tax, cash transfers, contributory pensions, and spending on education and health, and accounts for 63 percent of total revenues and 43 percent of total government spending. Consistent with previous studies, the paper finds that fiscal policy in China continues to redistribute quite effectively, achieving inequality reduction of about 10.3 Gini points, placing China around the median of upper-middle-income country peers on the level of redistribution achieved by fiscal policy. Not unlike several other countries where similar analysis has been done, most of the\ninequality reduction achieved by China is through education and health spending. Findings from the paper further suggest that while the fiscal system delivers more to those who need the most support, the heavy burden of user feesrelative to disposable income-may prevent some families from accessing needed health care services and imply high costs of raising children. In addition, there is room for the progressivity of the overall package to be enhanced. In particular, the fiscal system could make a greater dent in inequality by collecting more from those who could afford to pay more and leaving more money in the pockets of those who need it the most. This could be done by increasing the share of fiscal revenues collected through progressive taxes such as personal income tax and increasing the level of cash-based social benefits (such as residents' pensions and transfers).\n\nThis paper is a product of the Human Development Practice Group and the Poverty and Equity Global Practice.

      "3": "# Introduction \n\nChina's impressive economic performance over the last four decades has resulted in unparalleled improvements in living standards and poverty reduction. The rapid transformation of the economy-from agriculture to laborintensive manufacturing and services, as people moved from rural to urban areas and found better jobs-sustained strong growth over 40 years, raised average incomes, and lifted close to 800 million Chinese out of poverty (World Bank and Development Research Center of the State Council, 2022). On average, increased labor income accounted for around two-thirds of the poverty reduction between 1988 and 2007, with contributions shifting from increased agricultural productivity in the first decades, to increased opportunities and earnings in industry and services in the 2000s. This transformation was supported by a multi-pronged strategy that included investments not only in physical capital, but also in human capital by improving and expanding education and health services. From 2013 to 2018, public transfers among rural households in the bottom quintile almost doubled, driven by the increased coverage of rural pensions, the expansion of social assistance, social insurance and social assistance benefits, and the introduction of universal health care with a basic reimbursement package extended to rural areas.\n\nSince the 2000s, policy makers have turned to place-based fiscal support, public investment targeting rural areas and lagging provinces, and social assistance transfers to address growing concerns over inequality even as poverty kept declining. Disparities between urban and rural areas and between Eastern and Western regions rose in the first two decades of China's economic transformation. In response, starting in the mid-2000s, public investments in lagging regions combined with a rise in the minimum wage, the end of agricultural taxes, and an increased role for social protection policies helped narrow the urban-rural and regional gaps (World Bank, 2020). Income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient reported by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), peaked in 2008, declined for several years, and has recently stabilized at a relatively high level. Still, with a Gini coefficient at 46.7 in 2022 (latest available estimate), inequality remains high for China's level of development.\n\nReducing inequality remains an important priority as China pursues its longer-term development objectives. It is well recognized that the economy will need to rebalance from an investment- and export-led model based on highcarbon industry and low-cost, labor-intensive manufacturing toward one led by domestic consumption, services, and increases in productivity (World Bank and DRC, 2019). A larger share of income for the bottom of the distribution could support that transition, as poorer households tend to spend a larger share of their marginal income. China's green transition can also be facilitated through policies to ease labor mobility from high-carbon to lowcarbon sectors, as well as measures to strengthen the social safety net to ensure that those adversely affected by the transition are not left behind (World Bank, 2022c). In addition, China's population aging requires further investment in human capital potential to compensate for a shrinking labor force (World Bank and DRC, 2022). Closing gaps in access to quality public services will be key to ensuring equal economic opportunities and increased social mobility for future generations. Recognizing the challenge of inequality, China's government has made achieving \"common prosperity\" a priority. Policy makers continue to target sufficient economic growth that creates jobs and boosts household incomes. In addition, they also emphasize \"the roles of taxation, social security, and transfer payments in regulating income distribution\".\n\nHow governments spend and collect revenues can have implications for inequality. When essential services such as education are provided free of cost to segments of the population who may otherwise be unable to send their children to schools, public resources are redistributed to close income gaps between the rich and the poor. The same effect is achieved when targeted cash assistance is provided to the poorest and the most vulnerable members of society. Conversely, there may be instances in which certain subsidies provided by the government accrue more to",
      "4": "those who are already relatively rich, in which case the policy may end up widening gaps. Similarly, certain types of taxes that require the rich to pay more (relative to their income) can reduce inequality while, conversely, taxes that fall heavier on the poorer parts of the distribution, can contribute to widening gaps. Thus, how governments spend and raise their revenue directly influences the amount of redistribution the fiscal system achieves, which in turn influences inequality.\n\nThere has been relatively little enquiry on the role the overall fiscal system can play in reducing inequality in China. One notable exception is Lustig and Yang (2020) which used the Commitment to Equity approach (Lustig, 2018 and 2022) to describe the fiscal redistribution in China using data from the 2014 China Family Panel Studies survey. ${ }^{23}$ The main finding of that paper was that while the fiscal system reduced inequality overall, it also widened rural-urban gaps. The study attributed the latter to the differences in contributory pensions between urban and rural areas. These results were consistent with findings from several other studies (Li, Zhu and Zhan 2017 and Xie 2018), and somewhat contrary to Wang and Lou (2017) who found that the VAT had inequality-increasing impacts that were sizeable enough to make the overall fiscal system inequality-increasing.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, this paper revisits this question using more recent representative data of Chinese households, the 2018 round of the China Family Panel Survey (CFPS). The motivation for the paper is two-fold. First, inequality has continued to remain high even as the emphasis on common prosperity has intensified. As such, continuing to highlight the role fiscal policy has been playing and could play in addressing this challenge using fresh data and evidence is important. Second, since 2014 there have been several policy changes whose impacts can be picked up in the updated analysis, though in some cases this will be confounded by the fact that this paper also introduces some methodological upgrades. For example, Lustig and Yang (2020) treated all income from pensions as government transfers. This paper will depart from this assumption and attempt to treat contributory pensions which have characteristics of deferred income differently than pensions through the resident's system, which are more transfer-like.\n\nFollowing standard practices of fiscal incidence analysis, the study combines information from administrative sources on government revenues and spending with household survey data. This allows us to identify how much households pay in taxes and receive in transfers and subsidies, across the income distribution. The analysis includes fiscal elements such as personal income tax, contributions to social insurance, value-added tax, consumption tax, cash transfers, contributory pensions, and spending on education and health and accounts for 63 percent of total revenues and around 43 percent of total government spending. Several potentially important components of taxes and spending are not included in the analysis. These include, for example, corporate income taxes and non-tax elements on the revenue side and spending on infrastructure on the spending side. Both instruments can have sizeable redistributive impacts both in the short and medium run, but there is no satisfactory way of determining the incidence of these taxes on individual households. This practice is standard in fiscal analysis exercises and acknowledged as a caveat of the methodology.\n\nFirst, consistent with previous studies, this paper finds that fiscal policy achieves a sizeable inequality reduction (10.3 Gini points) in China. However, China places around the median of upper-middle-income country peers on\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Lustig, Nora and Yang Wang 2020. \"The Impact of Taxes and Transfers on Income Inequality, Poverty, and the Urban-Rural and Regional Income Gaps in China,\" Commitment to Equity (CEQ) Working Paper Series 93, Tulane University, Department of Economics.\n    ${ }^{3}$ The Commitment to Equity approach refers to the methodology developed by the Commitment to Equity Institute at Tulane University.

      "5": "the level of redistribution achieved by fiscal policy, suggesting there is significant room for the country to do more. Second, most of the inequality reduction achieved by China is through in-kind education and health benefits and social security contributions which are highly progressive. Yet, the heavy burden of health user fees -relative to households' disposable income- may discourage families accessing health care services when needed and school related user fees suggest the high cost of raising children. Cash transfers are equalizing but their contribution is rather small. The third main finding is that progressive and effective inequality reduction instruments such as personal income taxes remain relatively under-utilized.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides an overview of the fiscal system. This is followed by a description of the data and the methodology, including the introduction of the various income concepts that are critical for the analysis. The subsequent section describes the main results while the final section summarizes and concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for policy.\n\n# Overview of China's Fiscal System in 2018 \n\nIn this section, we provide an overview of China's fiscal system. As discussed in Lustig (2018), the redistributive power of a fiscal system depends on two crucial factors: size and progressivity. We present the size of China's total revenues by source, as well as China's total spending by category.\n\n## Total Revenue\n\nTotal fiscal revenue in China was 26,197 billion RMB in 2018 (3,950 billion in 2018 USD), representing 29.1 percent of total GDP. Table 1 shows its constituent parts: tax revenues, contributions to social insurance and nontax revenue. Tax revenues account for almost 60 percent of total revenue. Within taxes, the four largest items are value-added tax (VAT), corporate income tax, personal income tax and consumption tax. Contributions to social insurance amount to 30 percent of total revenue, the majority of which are collected through the employee's social insurance system and only 4 percent is collected through the resident's system. The employee's system is legally required for any type of formal employment while the resident's system covers those not covered by the employee's system. ${ }^{4}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Non-tax revenue accounts for the remaining $10 \\%$ of total revenue, and includes special program receipts, charge of administrative and institutional units, penalty receipts, operation income from government capital, income from use of state-owned assets/resources and other non-tax revenue.

It also uses a mix that relies more on social security contributions rather than on personal income taxes or indirect taxes other than VAT. China's social security contributions amount to 8.7 percent of its GDP, second only to Belarus (11.7- percent) among upper-middle income countries and is very close to the average of the high-income countries in the figure ( 8.8 percent). On the other hand, it collects just 1.5 percent of its GDP through personal income taxes, one of the lowest shares among upper-middle-income countries, far below highincome countries, and just slightly higher than average share of the low-income countries included in the figure (1.2 percent). China's collection of VAT ( 8.6 percent of GDP) and all other indirect taxes ( 0.2 percent of GDP) places it around the median of the high-income country average of 8.3 percent of GDP. China's own revenue mix also shows a notable shift between 2014 and 2018, with distinct increase in the share of revenues from social security contributions, VAT and a distinct reduction in the shares of other direct taxes, including personal and payroll taxes.",

The revenue elements included are thus the personal income tax, indirect taxes (value added and consumption tax), and social contributions. Taken together, these sources of revenue represent 69.3 percent of the government's total revenue in 2018 (Table 1). However, as will be discussed in the next section, due to data limitations, we are not able to capture the entirety of these taxes. We do not incorporate the corporate income tax, other taxes, nor all non-tax revenues in the analysis. These sources of revenue are important but excluded because there is no satisfactory way of determining the incidence of these taxes on individual households. As mentioned, this practice is standard in fiscal analyses and acknowledged as a caveat of the methodology (Lustig, 2018).\n\nA brief description of the revenue components included in the analysis is presented here. The personal income tax (PIT) is a tax levied on any income individuals earn throughout the year, including wages or salaries, business operation income, remuneration for services, property income, royalties for authorship and patents, and others. The total PIT collection reached 1,387 billion RMB in 2018, which accounted for 5.3 percent of total revenue and most of this amount came from taxes collected from wages or salaries ( 67.3 percent). ${ }^{5}$ Table 2 shows China's PIT tax\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ Since we use household survey data from 2018, the measure of PIT used does not include the recent reform of October 2018. This reform aimed to reduce residents' income tax burden and promote consumption by: i) establishing a higher exemption threshold (from 3,500 to 5,000 ), ii) achieving a smaller taxable object by introducing several deductible items, including children's education expenditure, adult's reeducation expenditure, medical expenditure on serious diseases, expenditure on supporting the elderly, expenditure on housing loan interests and rent; iii) introducing adjustments of the gradual tax rates scheme.",

The personal allowance is about twice the level of the average wage, implying that most workers are outside of the tax net (IMF, 2018). Relative to its regional comparators, China's marginal PIT rates are generally applied to lower income levels (Appendix Figure A1). However, the opposite is the case when comparing China to its high-income comparators, especially for the top tax rates. For instance, in China the marginal tax rate of 30 percent applies only to those with wages that are about 12 times the mean nominal wage. That threshold is much lower for several high-income countries where that level of marginal tax rate applies, on average, to workers with just 1.8 times the mean nominal wage.\n\nTable 2: Personal Income Tax (PIT) rates on wage/salary income, China 2018\n\n| Taxable Income Range (RMB per year) |  |  | Marginal Tax Rate |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| 0 | 18,000 |  | $3 \\%$ |\n| 18,001 | 54,000 |  | $10 \\%$ |\n| 54,001 | 108,000 |  | $20 \\%$ |\n| 108,001 | 420,000 |  | $25 \\%$ |\n| 420,001 | 660,000 |  | $30 \\%$ |\n| 660,001 | 960,000 |  | $35 \\%$ |\n| More than 960,000 |  |  | $45 \\%$ |\n| With standard personal allowance of RMB 42,000 |  |  |  |\n| Source: Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Individual Income Tax Law of the People's Republic of China, 2011 |  |  |  |\n\nThe value-added tax (VAT) is levied on goods or services at points at which value has been added, including during the processes of sale, service, and importation. This tax is the largest source of tax revenue in China, accounting for 50 percent of total tax revenue in 2018. ${ }^{6}$ In addition to the VAT, China has a consumption tax that is imposed on the purchase of items such as fuel, tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics, fine jewelry and precious gems, firecrackers and firework, refined oil, auto tires, motorcycles, automobile, golf equipment, high-end watches, yachts, disposable wood chopsticks, hardwood floor, batteries, and coating materials. ${ }^{7}$ Due to data limitations, we only include consumption tax of fuel, tobacco, and alcohol.\n\nContributions to social security vary depending on the program covered. The employee's system (also known as Urban worker scheme) requires employers to cover five insurance programs for their employees (pension insurance, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance) plus the housing fund. The contributions to each program are made by both employers and employees. Contribution rates vary at the local level, but the degree of variation is relatively minimal.

That same year the consumption tax levied on the wholesale process of cigarettes increased from $5 \\%$ to $10 \\%$, plus 0.005 yuan/item. Other reforms took place soon after.

Wage employees who are not covered by the employee system, including part-time employees, as well as self-employed workers, can opt to contribute to the system by reporting themselves as \"flexible workers\".

The resident programs are targeted at unemployed individuals, as well as at wage employees and self-employed workers who are not contributing to the employee system. These individuals can enroll voluntarily in both programs and can choose their contribution amounts within a predefined range. In addition, there are two groups of individuals covered by both resident's programs whose contributions come exclusively from the local government: adults under 60 years of age who are not covered by the employee's system who either live in households with incomes below the Dibao line or are disabled. The total amount collected from contributions to the resident's program is lower than the contributions collected by the the employee's system ( 338 billion RMB compared to 7523 billion RMB; see Appendix Table A2).\n\n# Total Current Expenditure \n\nChina's total public expenditure in 2018, including spending from central and local governments, was 22,090 billion RMB, which represented 24.5 percent of total GDP. Around half of this amount ( 37 percent) was allocated to social expenditure, about three-fifths to non-social expenditures ( 60 percent) and the remaining 3.4 percent to debt servicing (Table 4). Note further also that this category excludes spending through the Government Fund Budget (GFB) which is the source of most spending on infrastructure. The fiscal incidence analysis carried out here focuses mainly on allocating the social expenditure to households. The other categories, for instance infrastructure and defense included in non-social expenditure, are excluded from the analysis due to the difficulty of allocating their benefits to individuals. Within the social expenditure category, there are four subcategories: (i) education expenditure, (ii) health care expenditure, (iii) social insurance, social assistance \\& labor, and (iv) housing assistance.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ These resident programs were at first exclusively for rural residents (rural hukou), starting in 2003 in the case of the medical insurance program and in 2009 in the case of the basic pension insurance program.

For the pension programs, the number of contributors and beneficiaries in the resident's program ( 365 million and 159 million respectively) was relatively similar to the number of enrollees in the employee's program ( 301 million and 118 million respectively) but the contribution and pension amounts were orders of magnitudes lower for the resident's program (see Appendix A). In the case of the medical insurance program, the number of people covered under the resident's program ( 1,028 million) was more than three times larger than the number of people covered under the employee's program ( 317 million), in part because the residents' health insurance includes children (not included in the employees' system), and yet the contribution and benefit amounts were still significantly lower for the residents' program. These numbers indicate that the average contribution and pension or benefit amounts are much lower for those enrolled in the residents' programs relative to what is provided through the employee system.\n\nChina's social protection system also includes a social assistance component. Some of the main social assistance programs include the urban and rural Minimum Living Standard Scheme (Dibao), assistance for the extreme poor in both urban and rural areas (Tekun), temporary and natural disaster relief programs, as well as medical, education, housing and employment assistance programs (see Appendix Table 2 for summary statistics of these programs). The flagship cash transfer program Dibao provides cash transfers and employment opportunities to households whose income and living conditions are below local Dibao thresholds. The program is managed at the local level, and the value of benefits varies at the prefectural level.

The Tekun assistance program is aimed at helping the elderly, the disabled, and those aged below 16 without any supporter nor source of income and who are unable to work. The Tekun beneficiaries receive basic living arrangements, tendance, medical treatment, and proper burial. In 2018, 5.28 million individuals benefited from the Tekun assistance program, with average annual benefits of 10,650 yuan for urban recipients and 6,745 yuan for rural recipients. The Dibao and Tekun programs are mutually exclusive so that an individual cannot be a beneficiary of both programs simultaneously.

The main household survey data used is the 2018 China Family Panel Study (CFPS), which is a biennial longitudinal study with a 2010 baseline. This is a nationally representative survey that collects community, household, and individual sociodemographic characteristics of contemporary China. The estimated geographical distribution of the population using the CFPS is comparable to reports based on official data. For all estimations, we use CFPS individual weights to account for differences in the probability of selection of each group and ensure that the total weighted number of people matches with the population in the country, as reported by the National Bureau of Statistics. ${ }^{9}$\n\nThe information collected is suitable for carrying out fiscal incidence analysis as it includes individual labor income, household agricultural and business operation income, household rental income, financial investment profits, private transfers, auto-consumption, household expenditure by category, coverage of social insurance programs, reception of cash transfers and pension, as well as utilization of education and health services. The 2014 round of the CFPS was used in a previous fiscal incidence analysis for China (Lustig and Wang 2018). For the current analysis, we use the 2018 round, which contains the most recent available survey data. The 2018 round has information on 45,310 individuals from 14,218 households in 31 provinces/municipalities/autonomous regions. ${ }^{10}$\n\nTo model some of the interventions, we also rely on alternative surveys: the 2012 round of the CFPS and the 2019 China Household Finance Survey. Our second key source of information is administrative data. We use administrative data to validate the consistency of the survey-based estimates, as well as to conduct simulations and imputations when detailed information in the survey is not available. The main sources of administrative data are the Statistical Yearbook of China 2019, China Social Statistical Yearbook 2019, the 2019 Finance Yearbook of China, the 2018 Annual Report of Housing Fund, and 2018 Statistical Bulletin on Development of Human Resources and Social Security and information from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Housing and UrbanRural Development, and The People's Bank of China.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ CFPS-based estimates indicate that $54.1 \\%$ of individuals are urban residents and $38.5 \\%$ are rural residents, which is comparable to official reports showing a distribution of $59.6 \\%$ individuals residing in urban areas and $40.4 \\%$ in rural areas.

This method involves constructing a set of household income measures starting from pre-fiscal income (market income or market income plus pensions depending on whether contributory pensions are treated as a government transfer or as deferred income) and sequentially adding/subtracting fiscal interventions such as taxes, transfers and subsidies, to obtain several postfiscal income measures. The distributive impacts of overall fiscal interventions can then be analyzed by comparing inequality indicators using the pre-fiscal and post-fiscal income measures. The unit of analysis is the individual and the welfare measure is the household per capita income.\n\nFour income measures are constructed at different stages (see Figure 5):\n\n- The household's pre-fiscal income is the total income a household generates before it encounters the fiscal system. This measure includes the income the household received from wages and salaries, agricultural and business operation income, auto-consumption, property income, private transfers and remittances, and imputed rent of owner-occupied housing. When contributory pension (employee's pension) is considered as deferred market income (PDI scenario), it is also counted towards pre-fiscal income. Alternatively, contribution pension could be considered as government transfers (PGT scenario), in which pre-fiscal income does not include the contributory pension. We conduct the analysis using the PDI scenario while also presenting the PGT results in Appendix C.\n- The household's disposable income reflects how much income the household has available to spend on goods and services, or to save, after direct taxes (personal income tax and contributions to social security) are paid, and direct transfers (including cash transfers and pension receipts) are received. Resident's pension is always considered as transfers in our analysis, thus direct transfers for the PDI scenario include cash transfers and resident's pension benefits, and further include employee's pension benefit for the PGT scenario. Direct taxes include personal income tax and contribution to social security, which is without contribution to employee's pension for the PDI scenario, and with contribution to employee's pension for the PGT scenario. In other words, resident's pension, which has characteristics closer to a government transfer is treated as government transfer even in the PDI scenario.\n- The consumable income corresponds to the amount of goods and services the household can afford, once we consider indirect taxes (value-added tax and consumption tax), ${ }^{11}$ and indirect subsidies (for instance, cheaper agricultural inputs).\n- The final income incorporates a household's use of public services, such as public education or health services, which are sometimes accessed at a price below the value of the service received, and thus can be considered an in-kind transfer.\n\nThis framework is essentially an \"accounting approach\" because it ignores behavioral responses and general equilibrium effects. The primary interest of this exercise should be seen as a way to assess the progressivity of each fiscal intervention and overall progressivity of the fiscal system rather than to estimate the impact of the removal or addition of these interventions (Younger, 1997).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ The total effect of the value-added tax includes its direct effect on the prices of final goods and services, and its indirect effect, known as the cascading effect, on the prices of intermediate goods. We consider both the direct effect and indirect effects.",
      "14": "It should also be noted that in the analysis we are excluding public spending on, for example, infrastructure and public goods such as defense and some important categories of taxes (such as corporate income tax) because of the methodological challenges of allocating the economic benefit or burden to households. In the case of China, the exclusion of investments in public infrastructure such as rural roads is important to highlight. This means, that, for instance, unfortunately many of the poverty reduction development-oriented programs, which became a hallmark of public policies in the recent years, are not being considered and as such have not been accounted for. If data on the amount of resources spent at a local level were available (for instance, for poverty-stricken counties) as well as the identification of households in the survey as belonging to these areas, we may be able to incorporate these into the analysis.\n\nFigure 3: Construction of Income Measures\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nNote: Based on Lustig (2018)\n\n# Construction of income concepts \n\nFor our fiscal analysis, we construct the four income concepts from the CEQ framework as comprehensively as possible. There is one important difference with the general methodology illustrated in Figure 3. Typically, subsidies are added to the disposable income to construct the consumable income. However, in the case of China, some subsidies, especially toward agricultural inputs are distributed in the form of cash and the 2018 CPFS data does not distinguish these subsidies from direct transfers received. Therefore, some of these subsidies are implicitly included in our measure of disposable income that accounts for direct transfers. ${ }^{12}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ The agricultural subsidy is an array of policy instruments and is generally a mixture of cash transfers and price subsidies. Cash transfers are provided for promoting grain production, motivating superior crop varieties, and purchasing agricultural production materials (including fertilizers, diesel oil, seeds, and agricultural machinery). Price subsidies are provided for low-price agricultural machinery and tools. There is no directly identifiable information in the survey about indirect price subsidies. Also, it seems reasonable to assume that most households that benefited from price subsidies do not know the benefit amounts. Therefore, the agricultural subsidies reported as part of direct transfers in the survey are likely to be mostly direct cash payments.",
      "15": "The construction of the four income measures requires putting together several fiscal interventions. Table B2 in the appendix provides a list of all the interventions included in our analysis, indicating whether the information used was directly available in the household survey or needed to be imputed or simulated, when either the status (beneficiary/payer) or the amount received/paid was not reported directly in the survey.\n\nThe total amounts of revenue or spending from the survey (including imputations) do not always coincide with those from administrative data. This is to be expected. For many cases, these total amounts are nevertheless, comparable. But the range is wide and, in some cases, it is worth explaining the possible reasons behind the differences. For instance, the total amount of the personal income tax allocated or retrieved from households in the survey is about 57 percent of the total amount in the administrative dataset. In part, this reflects the limitation of household surveys to adequately capture information on the households at the top of the income distribution due to underreporting or non-response of rich households. The calculation of VAT provides another example of the data limitations. The VAT amount included in the analysis accounts for only 38 percent of the amount in administrative records due to the exclusion of durable goods from the analysis and the fact that final consumption of households only makes up for a portion of the total VAT. This is, however, a limitation that is standard for this type of analysis and as is recommended practice, for each of the fiscal components modeled in the analysis we present a detailed analysis of macro-validation in Appendix B.\n\n# Results \n\nCombining households' contributions and benefits to the fiscal system, five key features emerge. These features are summarized in Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4 shows the average taxes and contributions paid per year by each household market income decile (with bars below the horizontal axis), the average benefits received (bars above the horizontal axis) and the net impact (red dots), expressed in RMB. Figure 5 contains the same information, but contributions and benefits are expressed as a share of households' final income.\n\nFirst, the Chinese fiscal system is overall progressive. In absolute terms, poorer households receive a positive net benefit (receive more from the fiscal system than what they pay into it) while the net benefit position becomes more and more negative higher up the income distribution. Overall, with net fiscal position in the positive, more than 70 percent of the country's population is net beneficiary of the fiscal system. The fiscal system is also progressive in relative terms, especially with respect to in-kind education and health benefits that favor the relatively poor (Figure 5). Two observations are noteworthy. First, in gross terms, the overall value of the benefits received are worth quite a lot to households that receive them. For households in the poorest decile, for example, the total value of benefits received through the fiscal system is almost as large as their pre-fiscal income. Second, the value of the benefits declines as one moves up the income distribution, that is, the benefits account for a smaller share of pre-fiscal income as households become richer.",
      "16": "Figure 4. Averages of fiscal interventions, by pre-fiscal income decile\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 5. Fiscal interventions as a share of final income, by pre-fiscal income decile\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nNote: The primary y-axis in Figure 4 denotes averages of fiscal interventions and the unit is Yuan. The primary y-axis in Figure 5 denotes benefits and taxes as a share of final income. The secondary y-axis in both Figures 4 and 5 denote average final income by decile and the unit is Yuan.",
      "17": "Second, the progressivity of the fiscal system is driven for the most part by publicly provided education and health services. The light and dark green bars in Figures 4 and 5 represent net in-kind education and health benefits, respectively. Net in-kind benefits are computed as the difference between the in-kind benefit received (valued at the average cost of provision for those attending public schools or using health facilities) and user fees paid by households. In kind benefits are significantly higher than user fees (Figure 6), so the net effect is large. These benefits are largely progressive in relative terms, with poorer households receiving more than richer ones relative to their own income.\n\nIf one leaves out in-kind benefits and focuses purely on the cash-elements, the net fiscal position would be positive only for poorest two deciles suggesting that most Chinese households would be net-payers into the system if these in-kind benefits were not accounted for. The shape of the net benefit chart across the deciles is still downward sloping suggesting that the relatively richer households contribute more into the system as a share of their final incomes, so there is some element of progressivity built in.\n\nThree important additional remarks may be highlighted. First, while the average amount of net benefits is similar across the distribution, the composition differs: net education benefits are larger in absolute amount for lower income households, while net health benefits are, on average, larger among richer households (Figure 6). Second, the fact that households across income deciles pay on average similar RMB amounts of user fees (around RMB 1,500 in health, 400 RMB in education) means that the burden of these fees is very regressive and lands heavier on the poorer segments of the population, relatively to their total income. For households in the first decile, user fees for health care represent more than 20 percent of their final income. Indeed, despite the large increases in the health expenditure financed by the general government (doubling between 2000 and 2020), the share paid by households out of pocket stands at 35 percent, representing an order of magnitude higher than those observed in most rich countries (WDI 2024). Third, the existence of differences in quality of services provided and in population needs across the distribution can imply that even when the benefit levels received are the same for everyone, the system is not reducing inequality more broadly understood. Indeed, it is likely that public schools in better off parts of the country are able to deliver higher quality education, and that poorer households are in greater need of health services as poor health status is typically negatively correlated with income. Yet, in absolute terms, the poorest households receive higher health net transfers than households in the middle of the distribution but lower than households in the top of the distribution (deciles 9-10). Furthermore, households in the lowest decile spend more in private education than all other deciles except the top two deciles (Figure 6.C).\n\nFigure 6. Average Per Capita Amounts of Health and Education Fiscal Interventions, by Decile\nA. Health Fiscal Interventions\nB. Education Fiscal Interventions",
      "18": "![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\nC. Average Spending on Private Education by Decile\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\nThird, cash benefits are low but are essential for those at the bottom of the distribution. For the poorest households, 20 percent of their final income comes from Residents' pension benefits ( 11 percent) and cash transfers ( 9 percent). The average amount received by the first decile is also higher than for the rest of the deciles, in absolute terms. Despite the relatively modest cash amounts of both residents' pension and cash transfers, they do help lower overall inequality as will be shown later. Still, these amounts are low, particularly in poorer provinces and rural areas, where the benefit is a small fraction of average wages. Compared to the average pension received by those that contributed to the Employee System, the average pension for those in the resident's pension system is 10 times lower on average (World Bank, China Economic Update, December 2023). Considering cash transfers, overall coverage is low ( 14 percent of households) and significantly lower if we consider only the flagship cash transfer program Dibao. This program covers less than 4 percent of the population, compared with an average of 17.6 percent of the population among upper-middle-income countries (World Bank, ASPIRE database). Most households in the program are those whose members are unable to work due to age or disabilities. As such, the program has limited reach for households that may experience unexpected fall in income due to loss of employment or business.\n\nFourth, and as expected, richer households contribute more to the fiscal system than poorer ones in relative terms, contributing to the progressiveness of the system. Households pay into the fiscal system in the form of PIT, VAT, and consumption taxes on their purchases and through their contributions into the employee or resident",
      "19": "social security schemes. There are several reasons for why richer households contribute more. First, the rich consume more than the poor in monetary terms and, as such, the average per capita value of VAT and consumption taxes paid are also higher. Second, higher earners contribute more to the social security system, as these contributions (particularly the employee scheme) are indexed to earned income. Finally, the PIT accounts for a small share of payments into the fiscal system relative to that collected via indirect taxes and social security contributions and is concentrated mostly among households in the top decile. On average, through personal income taxes, social contributions, and indirect taxes, the top decile accounts for 47 percent of all contributions to the national fiscal system whereas the second-richest decile contributes 18 percent. Together, the top three deciles account for over two-thirds of the total contributions into the fiscal system. The concentration on PIT is even greater, with the top decile alone accounting for 83 percent of the total collected.\n\nFifth, while PIT is highly progressive in its structure, only few contribute. This narrow fiscal base arises in part from the high-income concentration at the top deciles, with the market income of the top three deciles accounting for three-quarters of total market income. But in addition, as discussed previously, the high standard personal allowance means that a significant share of individuals in the lower deciles do not pay this tax.\n\nTaken together, the fiscal interventions included in the analysis reduce inequality - as measured by the Gini index - by about 10.3 points. Starting from a pre-fiscal or market income Gini of 54.5 points, Figure 7 shows the values of the Gini index using the income measures that sequentially incorporate the fiscal interventions we consider. The index decreases 2.8 points at disposable income, which incorporates direct taxes and transfers. It decreases slightly ( 0.01 points) when indirect taxes are incorporated to construct the consumable income. The highest decrease of 7.4 points occurs when we get to the measure of final income which incorporates health and education in-kind transfers and user fees. Results for the PGT version of the analysis yield a slightly higher rate of inequality reduction from market to final income (12.1) with an expected larger role played by contributory pensions which the PGT scenario would have regarded as government transfers. The disposable income Gini under PGT would have been 4.7 points lower than market income Gini, which is quite a bit higher than the 2.8 -point difference between pre-fiscal and disposable under PDI. Results are qualitatively similar when we use the Theil index as alternative measures of inequality (see Appendix Figure C1).",
      "20": "Figure 7. Gini Index, from pre-fiscal to final income\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nNotes: The figure shows inequality measured using the Gini index at various income concepts. Direct taxes and transfers are applied to pre-fiscal income to get to disposable income. Indirect taxes applied to disposable income yields consumable income and final income is obtained by adding in-kind health and education benefits less user fees paid by households to access these benefits. Contributory pensions are treated as deferred income while resident's pensions are treated as transfer.\n\nThe inequality reduction achieved by China is the average of several countries and is around the median for the upper-middle-income countries for which similar analysis has been done (Figure 8). Similar analyses examining the extent to which fiscal systems redistribute effectively and reduce inequality have now been done in more than 80 countries around the world. What has been found is that fiscal systems generally lower inequality in countries at all income levels and all levels of initial inequality. However, the amount of success countries are able to achieve in using fiscal policies to lower inequality varies quite a bit with the country income level seeming to be an important factor. Taking the sample of countries where similar analysis has been done in a comparable manner, we see that the inequality reduction achieved by fiscal policy is in the 0-4 Gini points in low-income countries, 114 range in the lower middle-income countries, 2-19 in upper middle-income countries and 7-13 in high income countries. Using this as a benchmark, the 10.3 Gini points in inequality reduction that China achieves is around the median for both the upper middle-income country and the high-income country range.",

Change in the Gini Index, from pre-fiscal to final income\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nNotes: Original estimates based on data from CEQ Institute, CEQ Data Center on Fiscal Redistribution, https://commitmentoequity.org /datacenter; OECD data; World Bank data. Countries are grouped according to World Bank Income classification system starting with Low Income Countries (LIC), Lower Middle Income Countries (LMIC), Upper Middle Income Countries (UMIC) and High Income Countries (HIC)",
      "22": "Education and benefits drive redistribution while the role of progressive tax policy instruments such as PIT is modest. To assess the marginal contribution of each fiscal intervention to the reduction of inequality, we calculate the difference between the Gini index of final income with and without the specific fiscal intervention (Figure 9). A positive marginal contribution means the intervention item was equalizing, i.e., contributed to lowering inequality, while a negative marginal contribution means the intervention had an inequality increasing impact. Several observations stand out. First, consistent with what we saw in terms of the size of the benefits in absolute and relative terms, in-kind benefits provided through health and education services turn out to be strongest drivers of the inequality reduction China's fiscal system achieves accounting for Gini reduction of 4.2 and 5.3 points respectively. In contrast, the role played by progressive tax instruments such as PIT is somewhat more modest. PIT is equalizing but its contribution to inequality reduction is a fraction of what is achieved through spending on education and health. This limited role is a consequence of China's relatively low collection of PIT, and the fact that most of it is paid by the richest decile with little variation across the other deciles.\n\nFigure 9. Marginal contribution to inequality reduction\n![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)\n\nNotes: The figure shows marginal contribution each of the fiscal instrument makes to the reduction of inequality\n\nUser fees in both education and health have an inequality increasing impact suggesting that the burden of these fees lands heavier on the poorer segments of the population. In fact, the magnitude of inequality reduction achieved by cash transfers and residents' pension put together is not large enough to offset the increase in inequality due to regressive user-fees. This points to a possible room for improvement in these programs, both in terms of being more generous and perhaps also better targeted in the case of cash transfers. ${ }^{13}$ Finally, the mild positive contribution of VATs to inequality reduction is intriguing as VATs are often regarded as regressive, at least in relative terms. This\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{13}$ It is also worth bearing in mind that as discussed earlier, our measure of cash transfer captures elements of assistance other than cash transfers (e.g., agricultural subsidy) which is probably exaggerating its benefit size while at the same time understating the level of targeting.",
      "23": "is likely because of the adjustment we make to account for possible informality of consumption, which is likely to be more prevalent among households at lower parts of the income distribution. This would be consistent with other recent evidence that shows that VATs can be progressive when informality of consumption is accounted for. (Bachas et al 2023). Had we not accounted for the possible informality of purchases as we do here, the marginal contributions of VAT would be closer to -0.60 , which suggests that the informality of purchases in rural areas (which we proxy for using measures from Thailand) shields poorer households from VAT to a certain extent.\n\n# Discussion and Conclusion \n\nIn this paper we have applied the standard fiscal incidence analysis to data from the China Family Panel Study 2018 to study the effect of government taxes and spending on inequality in China. The analysis includes fiscal elements such as personal income tax, contributions to social insurance, value-added tax, consumption tax, cash transfers, contributory pensions, and spending on education and health and accounts for 63 percent of overall total revenues and 43 percent of total government spending. The findings suggest that China already achieves quite a bit of inequality reduction through its fiscal policies but there is ample room for the country to do more. Greater reliance on progressive fiscal instruments such as PIT would not only enhance redistribution but also generate fiscal resources China could use to address future drivers of inequality such as population aging and climate change. In addition, there is scope to make social assistance more effective in responding to economic transitions and demographic trends. Cash transfer programs could expand dynamic monitoring systems (currently being piloted in a few cities such as Chongqing and Hangzhou) to be able to quickly respond to vulnerable families that experience unexpected income falls or increases in critical spending (such as on health care). Rapid aging of the population also requires reconsidering reforms to increase the adequacy of the resident pension system while ensuring its sustainability.\n\nSocial spending and human capital investment already contribute significantly to reducing inequality, but the hard task of shifting China's growth model, decarbonizing the economy, and dealing with population aging will require further investment in human capital. China has more than doubled its spending on education over the last 15 years, but at 3.6 percent of GDP in 2018 it was still lower than the average for the upper-middle-income countries (UMICs) of 4.5 percent. Spending on health ( 1.7 percent of GDP) was similarly about half of the UMIC average of 3.4 percent. Spending better would be just as important to close access and quality gaps across economic sectors and geographic regions. Expanding coverage of social assistance programs to cover those beyond the extreme lowincome families unable to work, controlling rising health care costs, addressing gaps that exist within the two-tiered social insurance system (for instance, by increasing the benefits of the resident pension system, particularly in rural areas), and ensuring portability of social benefits, are all improvements that could lower the burden of out-of-pocket spending for the relatively less well-off (World Bank and DRC 2022).\n\nTurning to the revenue side of the budget, China's domestic revenue mobilization level is higher than the upper-middle-income country average, though still below the OECD average. As countries develop, their ability to collect revenue from domestic sources improves. The tax base broadens, greater numbers of workers and firms engage in formal economic activities and administrative capabilities of the state improve, making it easier to collect different types of taxes effectively and efficiently. Average revenue collection for low-income countries (LIC) is 18.3 percent of GDP. This increases to 21.5 for lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), 25.6 percent for the UMICs, and 39.6",
      "24": "percent of GDP for OECD countries. At 29.1 percent of GDP, China's overall domestic revenue mobilization in 2018 was above the UMIC average (Figure 10).\n\nHowever, China collects a greater share of revenues in indirect taxes compared to richer countries. China's heavy reliance on indirect taxes such as the VAT and its relative underutilization of direct tax instruments such as the PIT make its revenue mix somewhat inconsistent with its level of development. As countries develop, their reliance on broad consumption-based indirect taxes declines. For example, VAT and excise taxes account for 34 percent of total revenue for LMICs, 33 percent for UMICs, and 23 percent in OECD countries. In China, indirect taxes accounted for 35 percent of total revenue in 2018. Richer countries also collect more in PIT. PIT accounts for 2.5 percent of GDP in LMICs, 2.8 percent in UMICs, and 8.5 percent of GDP in the OECD. As share of total revenue, PIT is 21 percent in the OECD. By comparison, only 5 percent of total revenues come from PIT in China.\n\nFigure 10. Richer countries rely more on direct taxes such as PIT; reliance on indirect taxes such as VAT is higher among poorer countries\n(Revenue as $\\%$ of GDP)\n![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)\n\nSource: International Centre for Tax and Development. Numbers for China are based on Finance Yearbook of China 2019. Note: The figure shows the composition of government revenue as a percentage of GDP, aggregated by income group. OECD countries form a separate group. Data by revenue type are from 2020 when available or the most recent available year back to 2015. The sample includes 155 economies. CIT = corporate income tax; GDP = gross domestic product; HICs = high-income countries; LICs = low-income countries; LMICs = lower-middle-income countries; OECD = Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development; PIT = personal income tax; CSS = contribution to social security; UMICs = upper-middle-income countries; VAT = value added tax.\n\nIndirect taxes are generally regressive, as the burden of these taxes falls disproportionately on the lower deciles of the income distribution. Indirect taxes are applied on the level of consumption and, because poorer households spend a larger share of their income on consumption (compared to richer ones), indirect taxes paid account for a greater share of their incomes too. Even though informality of purchases plausibly shields some of the lower income",
      "25": "consumers, this is likely to be an increasingly weakening cover as greater use of e-commerce and other digital platforms expands the share of formal transactions. In contrast, personal income taxes are progressive and have the potential to significantly enhance the progressivity of the entire fiscal system. China's PIT, despite a relatively progressive structure (comparable to OECD countries), has relatively wide income brackets and a large personal allowance. The personal allowance is twice the size of the average per capita income from wages and salaries and several times the average wage in many cities. (IMF 2018) Hence, the tax base is small, given that most workers do not pay income tax at all, while those with slightly higher wages pay only little, given the low introductory tax rates and the wide salary bands. The top marginal tax rate of 30 percent applies only to those with about 5 times the average wage, affecting only a small minority of workers with very high incomes. This is reflected in the relative incidence of PIT. In China, the top 10 percent of the income distribution pays just 2.8 percent of pre-fiscal income in PIT in comparison to 8.1 percent in UMICs and 27.5 percent in the OECD.\n\nIn sum, there are opportunities on both the revenue and expenditure sides of China's budget to make fiscal policies more progressive and help address inequality. The analysis presented in this paper shows that the fiscal system delivers great value to those who need the most support, but the progressivity of the overall package could be substantially enhanced. In particular, the fiscal system could make a greater dent in inequality by collecting more from those who could afford to pay more and leaving more money in the pockets of those who need it the most. This could be done by increasing the share of fiscal revenues collected through progressive taxes such as the PIT and property taxes. Property taxes also put resources directly in the hands of local governments, which are responsible for 80 percent of public spending in China. On the expenditure side, China's fiscal system is already contributing significantly to reducing inequality, especially via in-kind health and education benefits. Further improvements could focus on closing the remaining gaps in access to high-quality public services (e.g., for migrant workers and rural residents). In addition, increasing the level of social benefits and ensuring that they are portable could help make China's green transition fair by assisting those most vulnerable to adverse weather and job losses related to climate change.",

      "31": "# Appendix B: Methodology to construct income measures \n\nTo construct all the fiscal interventions in our analysis, we rely directly on information reported in the survey when available or we conduct simulation and imputations when the information we need is not available. If the status of a household or individual as beneficiary or payer of a fiscal intervention is reported in the survey but the amount received or paid is not reported, then we need to impute the amount. If the status is not reported, we need to first simulate that status and then impute the amount. We conduct imputations or simulations following policy rules and exploiting available information in household surveys and statistics from administrative data. Appendix Table B2 provides a list of all the interventions included in our analysis, indicating whether the information used is directly available in the household survey or needed to be imputed or simulated.\n\n## Personal income tax\n\nTo impute personal income tax, we follow the tax rate schedule and account for non-compliance. The amount included in the analysis represents $61 \\%$ of the total amount in the administrative dataset (Appendix Table B2). Part of the explanation relies on the well-known limitation of household surveys failing to adequately capture information on the households in the top of the income distribution.\n\nPost-tax labor income, business operation income and property income are reported in CFPS 2018, from which PIT are backward imputed applying corresponding personal income tax rates. For the post-tax labor income, regular monthly wage, annual bonus and income from internship/part-time job are all subject to PIT, we calculate PIT related to each income component by applying relevant personal income tax rates (see Table B1). Partial compliance assumption is imposed, assuming those who work in government units, administrative institutions and state-owned enterprises pay PIT, as well as other employees who have formal job contracts and those who reported contributions to social insurances. For the business operation income, we assume the effective personal income tax rate in 2018 is $78.5 /(3,840+78.5)=2 \\%$, where 78.5 billion is the PIT related to self-employed business operation income according to China Tax Yearbook 2019, and 3,840 billion is urban residents' total disposable operation income according to National Bureau of Statistics. For the property income, it is composed by rent and financial investment profits. We assume rent fully evade PIT, and PIT of financial investment profit is calculated applying $20 \\%$ tax rate.\n\nTable B1.

Respondents who do not declare as contributing to any of the systems, we assume that those who work in government units, administrative institutions, and stated-own enterprises, as well as other employees who reported having a formal job contract, are formal employees contributing to the employee system and we impute the amount contributed. Moreover, there is a significant share of contributors to the employee system who did not report the amount and therefore needs to be imputed; we impute the amounts for the formal employees among those. ${ }^{14}$ The contributions are imputed using reported salary and contribution schemes of the capital city corresponding to the individual's province of residence. We further impute the contributions from the employer side, while self-employed are assumed to pay all contributions out-of-pocket. The total amount of contributions to social security included in the analysis is similar to that in administrative records, accounting for $102 \\%$ of that amount (Appendix Table B2).\n\n## Contributions to social security to the resident system\n\nThe survey has information on whether individuals contribute to the resident's system but lacks information on the amount contributed. To impute these amounts, we use average contributions to the residents' medical insurance reported in the China Household Finance Survey 2019 by geographic location (rural/urban and province) and age groups. Given the contribution is exempted for Dibao or Tekun recipients and residents with disabilities in most provinces, we assume enrollers from households reported receiving any type of cash transfers pay 0 to the resident's medical insurance. The national average contribution to resident's pension insurance can be obtained from administrative data, and provincial level variations are generated based on provincial maximum and minimum statutory contribution levels. The total amount of contributions to social security included in the analysis is similar to that in administrative records, accounting for $62 \\%$ of that amount (Appendix Table B2).\n\n## Direct cash transfers\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ We do not impute the contribution amounts of self-employed individuals nor of informal employees. Self-employed individuals join the employee social security system as free-lancers and can choose from several contribution levels based on their own preferences and own financial capacities. We do not estimate their preferences. Regarding informal employees, it may be that some employers pay regular contributions for informal employees, but it is also possible that the employers don't pay CSS for the informal workers and the workers join the employee's programs as free-lancers.",
      "33": "The CFPS 2018 does not distinguish direct cash transfers from reforestation and agricultural subsidies. Therefore, in our case, the disposable income measure implicitly includes subsidies, as opposed to the typical case where subsidies are incorporated in the measure of consumable income. We cannot properly compare the amount of cash transfers included in the analysis to its administrative counterpart because we lack administrative information on transfers regarding rural five guarantees, reforestation and agricultural subsidies, which are included in the total aggregated amount reported in the survey. Excluding those subsidies, the administrative transfer amounts of all the remaining programs that are explicitly listed in the survey add up to 305 billion RMB, which is close to the 383 billion RMB amount included in the analysis.\n\n# Pensions \n\nThe survey report pensions received without specifying whether it comes from the employee's or the resident's pension system. Given pension type is available in CFPS 2014 data, we try to match individual samples in both 2014 survey and 2018 survey in order to identify pension type. Among those whose pension type is still unidentified after the matching, we assume those retired from government units or admin institutions and those reported last employment as employee receive employee's pension not resident's pension. Total pension in analysis accounts $71 \\%$ of its administrative counterpart.\n\n## VAT\n\nIn the CFPS 2018, household monthly or annual expenditures are reported by categories. The estimated relevant VAT rate for each reported expenditure category is a weighted effective VAT rate, including the VAT rates of all the sectors in the IO matrix related to that expenditure category. The VAT rates of each sector are those reported by the tax authority and the weights are obtained using the value-added of the sectors in the IO matrix. Imputed total VAT in the analysis equals 2,940 billion RMB, and total 2018 VAT in admin. data is 7,777 billion RMB (including VAT of domestic and imported goods).\n\nVAT burden assignment proceeds in the following steps.\n\n- Consumption expenditure by category is reported at household level in CFPS 2018.\n- For each consumption expenditure category, locate its relevant productions sectors in the InputOutput table and assign the proper statutory VAT rate to each production sector\n- Then, VAT paid by each production sector= value-added produced by the sector*statutory VAT rate, and VAT rate (direct effect) for each consumption expenditure category $=\\mathrm{VAT}$ paid by all relevant production sectors/value-added produced by all relevant production sectors\n- The indirect effect of VAT is further considered in our analysis, which refers to how the VAT may affect inputs prices thus increase consumer's burden. The rate of indirect effect for each consumption expenditure category can be obtained by solving the price-shifting model (Lustig, 2022).\n- Using Thailand's rural informal purchase rates by decile we further adjust the imputed VAT of rural residents.\n\nFollowing the CEQ methodology framework, we exclude VAT of durable goods (including costly goods such as real estate and automobiles) in order to avoid overestimation of VAT for the current period given that these goods are likely to have been purchased before the survey period. This exclusion partly explains",
      "34": "why the VAT amount included in the analysis accounts for only $38 \\%$ of the amount in administrative records (see Table B2), since some durable goods may have been purchased during the relevant period. Another important reason for the underestimation of the VAT is that final consumption of households only contributes a portion of the total VAT collected by the government. A study of 26 European Union countries and Japan finds that more than a third of total VAT is attributable to intermediate consumption and capital formation by non-taxable and exempted activities (Ueda, 2017).\n\nConsumption tax only part of the consumption tax can be included into analysis due to data limitations. Using statutory tax rates, we impute consumption tax paid on alcohol, tobacco, and fuel. Our imputed amounts add up to $62 \\%$ of the total consumption tax amount in administrative records.\n\nThe survey only reports information on household expenditure on cosmetic products, so we need to simulate expenditure on alcohol and tobacco, as well as on fuel. For alcohol and tobacco, we estimate the relationship between the consumption of these items and sociodemographic characteristics using data from the CFPS 2012 and then use those parameters to predict the amounts consumed in 2018. For fuel, we assume households who reported car ownership bear consumption tax on fuel and use and then we assume that $70.26 \\%$ of the expenditure on local transportation of those households can be attributed to fuel. The share $70.26 \\%$ is the ratio between 857.6 billion RMB (which is the value-added in the sector of refined petroleum products, nuclear fuel processing products in the 2018 IO matrix, which is our estimate of expenditure on fuel) and the sum of 362.9 billion RMB and 857.6 billion RMB (where 362.9 billion RMB is the valueadded in the sector of urban public transport and highway passenger transport in the 2018 IO matrix).\n\nOnce the imputed VAT and consumption tax are available, following page 273 of Vol.1, CEQ 2022 Handbook (Lustig, 2022), a rescale factor need to be applied to the imputed indirect taxes, which is 'Household Disposable Income/Household Total Consumption'.\n\n# In-kind health transfers and user fees \n\nTotal cost of health services and copayments shouldered by households are reported in the survey. The inkind health transfer is the reported total cost of medical care in the past year plus provincial level per capita government expenditure on public health. ${ }^{15}$ We assume all health care received is public given that the survey does not allow to distinguish the type of provider. This assumption is reasonable given that most of the health care in China is provided by public institutions. ${ }^{16}$ The health user-fee is the reported out-ofpocket payments paid directly by the family, that is, the amount that was not reimbursed. The total in-kind health transfers and user fees reported in the survey add up to $86 \\%$ and $133 \\%$ of the respective amounts reported in administrative data (Appendix Table B2).\n\n## In-kind education transfers and user fees\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{15}$ Given the definition of government expenditures on public health obtained from National Bureau of Statistics, we know it is in addition to the net benefit received by households (net benefit=total cost of health services minus copayment). We decided to include per capita government expenditure on public health as an additional part of in-kind health transfers as there does not seem to be any double counting.\n    ${ }^{16}$ In 2015, public institutions accounted for 85 percent of admissions, and 88 percent of outpatient visits (World Bank; World Health Organization. 2019).",
      "35": "For education, survey respondents report whether each household member is attending public schools and which instruction level they are currently attending. Using this information, we impute in-kind education transfers for each public-school student as the reported provincial per pupil government expenditure by instruction level from administrative records. We impute education user fees as the national average tuition by instruction level from administrative records. Given that we use administrative data to impute all inkind education transfers and user fees, in both cases the amounts in analyses are quite close to the administrative amounts ( $82 \\%$ and $96 \\%$ respectively).",

      "1": "# Abstract \n\nIn recent years, alongside democratic backsliding and security threats, censorship is increasingly used by governments and other societal actors to control the media. Who is likely to be affected by censorship and why? Does censorship as a form of punishment coexist with or act as a substitute for reward-based forms of media capture such as market concentration or bribes? First, this argues that censors employ censorship only toward certain targets that provide information to politically consequential audiences, while allowing\nmedia that caters to elite audiences to report freely. Second, the paper hypothesizes that coercion and inducements are substitutes, with censorship being employed primarily when bribes and ownership fail to control information. To test these hypotheses, a new data set was built of 9,000 salient censorship events and their characteristics across 196 countries between 2001 and 2015. The study finds strong empirical support for the theory of media market segmentation.\n\nThis paper is a product of the Development Data Group, Development Economics.

Education and internal communications have now been so largely developed, and a disaffected press has been so many years at work, that libels against the government have become a political danger, which it is the duty of the criminal courts to check, and, if possible, to uproot by stern justice.\n\nA judge of the British Raj, 1905 (in Darnton 2014, 132)\n\nFollowing the 1990s wave of democratization, some observers of the newly gained media freedoms held two core beliefs. First, that autocratic regimes censored all media indiscriminately, while democracies rarely engaged in censorship. Second, welcoming the prompt legal bans on official censorship, that blatant Soviet-style coercion is an obsolete strategy of information control and will be replaced by more subtle forms of media capture via economic inducements, such as concentration of ownership and bribery. The oligopolistic nature of the media market in many developing countries and its informal connections to government officials and politicians can indeed secure an informational environment dominated by pro-government reporting without resorting to repressive tactics or the use of coercion.\n\nTwenty-five years later, both assumptions have been challenged by evidence. Many autocrats including some of the communist regimes, despite curbing freedoms systematically, allowed dual information control systems to co-exist. Media catering to narrow elite audiences",
      "4": "could publish or broadcast politically sensitive materials, whereas outlets targeting large audiences were systematically censored. Moreover, over the last decade, in contrast to the early transition optimism, following general trends in democratic backsliding and security threats, 'old-time' media censorship trends have dramatically increased around the world, affecting both democracies and autocracies, with negative consequences for the overall quality of political institutions and civil liberties.\n\nYet domestic variations in strategies of censorship and its targets are currently undertheorized. Who are the censors? Who is likely to be most affected by censorship and why? Are all media outlets equally exposed to capture? Are media capture tools based on coercion (censorship) or inducements (bribes and economic control) mutually exclusive or do they work jointly to insure information control? We argue that individual exposure to punitive measures depends on the size of a media outlet's audience and on the transaction costs of censorship. Irrespective of political regime type, censors are likely to allow free information in narrow, elite segments of the media market while suppressing it for larger audiences that, as the historical quotation above suggests, include a critical enough number of voters to pose a political risk for the incumbent when exposed to compromising information left uncensored. Building on the seminal Besley and Prat (2006) model of media capture, the paper proposes two major sets of hypotheses. First, censors economize coercion by targeting only the politically threatening segments of the media market. Second, punitive and inducement-based capture are substitutes, except for media outlets that pose the highest political threat, where capture tools act jointly to insure compliance.\n\nSince currently there are no individual-level data that allow us to test empirically whether the segmentation of news consumption can lead to heterogeneous levels of censorship within a country's media market, we generated a new cross-national data set containing around 9,000",
      "5": "salient censorship events and their characteristics, and covering 196 countries between 2001 and 2015. Conventional wisdom commonly associates censorship with autocratic regimes. We show that censorship also systematically affects advanced and wealthy democracies, and that it is committed by both governments and non-governmental actors alike. Our findings suggest that when controlling for country-level characteristics, censorship is indeed likely to disproportionately affect journalists and media outlets that reach the broadest politically consequential audiences. We assume that the political importance of an audience depends on whether it includes the median voter and/or whether its collective mobilization as a result of uncensored news would threaten the government and other censors. The paper also captures a substitutability effect on the media market between punitive censorship and economic forms of media capture. This is not a case of the high-frequency media where short timelines and unpredictability make censors jointly use all forms of capture to maximize information control.\n\nThis study aims at making a two-fold contribution to the academic literature on media capture as well as to the policy efforts to operationalize the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), by proposing a theoretical mechanism that accounts for strategic variation of censorship targets and by testing it on an original data set. Understanding these processes is particularly salient now that SDG 16 explicitly calls for better measurement of public access to information, with a focus on media personnel safety. The paper proceeds as follows. First, we review the relevant literature. Second, we propose a formal model. Third, after introducing our new data set, we verify whether the hypotheses derived from our model hold empirically and analyze the results. Finally, a short conclusion summarizes the findings and suggests avenues for further research.",
      "6": "# 2. Literature Review \n\n### 2.1 What is censorship?\n\nAccording to an operational definition, censorship means \"direct and indirect suppression of speech, books, music and other materials considered morally, politically or otherwise objectionable\" (IFEX 2017). Historically, the meaning and purposes of such suppression have been context specific, rather than universalistic, and did not always have a negative connotation (Darnton 2014). In Ancient Rome, the office of the censor was tasked with educating citizens, and filtering speech and text was perceived, by some, as a legitimate strategy for pursuing societal goals. The Founding Fathers of the United States defended the idea of the censor as social welfare maximizer and final guarantor of information quality. A similar curatorial approach has been documented even in some of the more recent censorship regimes of Cold War autocracies.\n\nCensorship of the media, one subset of the broader targets of information suppression, commonly refers to formal or informal interference with the freedom of media outlets, individual journalists and other media professionals which prevents them from exercising freedom of expression and performing their daily work - collecting information, exchanging ideas and reporting to the public \"through any media and regardless of frontiers\", as per Article 19 of the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\nTypes of interference vary widely from a systematic lack of access to government information to the suppression of publications or the torture, killings or disappearance of journalists and their collaborators. Despite the instinct to associate censorship with government action, the censor(s) often take the form of non-state actors, such as organized crime networks,",
      "7": "foreign armies or radical religious groups. The empirical section of this paper introduces new data that demonstrate such varieties.\n\nWhat renders censorship difficult to study comparatively is the subtlety with which it occurs in many contexts. While legal restrictions of access to information are easy to identify, the line between regulatory harassment of media outlets and censorship, as well as the culture of selfcensorship - or self-refraining from reporting on politically sensitive information - are blurrier and much harder to systematically capture. Media censorship is the final outcome of an institutional ecosystem that goes beyond legal restrictions governing reporting and publishing. Informal political pressures, advertising revenue rules or media market concentration can place significant constraints on the informational environment.\n\n# 2.2 Political costs and benefits of media censorship \n\nThe consequences of censorship for policy makers in terms of both benefits and costs are well documented. The benefits for political leaders and bureaucrats revolve around being shielded from public scrutiny. This allows them to pursue private agendas, including corrupt activities and abuses of power or contested public policies, without running the risk of criticism and without the threats of collective action that an information-free environment can facilitate. Existing cross-national and country-specific evidence strongly suggests that a lack of information facilitates the use of public office for private gain (Brunetti and Weber 2003; Adsera et al. 2003; Besley and Burgess 2002; Keefer and Khemani 2014; Ferraz and Finan 2008; Strömberg 2004), and political underperformance in terms of public good production (Djankov et al. 2003). For autocratic leaders",
      "8": "in particular, censoring the media is an essential strategy of rule because it prevents public contestation of policies, the revelation of human rights infringements or high-level political corruption (Van Belle 2000).\n\nCensorship is not without costs for censors in democracies and non-democracies. Vibrant news reporting grants politicians electoral visibility, and, in contexts with legitimacy deficits, provides the veneer of respect for fundamental freedoms of expression. A higher likelihood of losing office leads to increased political costs of censorship as future uncertainties of rule make incumbents likely to secure access to information if and when they lose elections (Berliner 2014). In fact, within autocracies and democracies alike, political competition increases the costs of censorship since a relatively free media grants public visibility for politicians, allowing them to pander or posture to their electoral constituency (Malesky et al. 2012; Strömberg 2015). Surprisingly, even some of the most repressive autocrats tolerate or encourage a certain extent of free media because of legitimacy concerns (Whitten-Woodring 2009).\n\nMedia freedom also allows political principals to monitor the performance of agents such as bureaucrats or politicians of lower tier governments, thus minimizing moral hazard problems. Even in autocratic regimes where media may facilitate collective action, the benefits of press freedom are non-trivial for the government. Investigative journalism helps central leadership collect and transmit credible information about lower level officials, thus contributing to improved bureaucratic oversight and governance (Egerov et al 2009; Lorentzen 2014). In the words of one Chinese journalist who protested a local censor's interference, \"if media lose all credibility and influence, then we ask, how is the ruling Party to speak?\" (Richburg 2013)\n\nCounterintuitively, limiting censorship boosts the credibility of pro-government narratives irrespective of regime type. A provocative study of US White House whistleblowers asked why a",
      "9": "surprisingly low number of leaks to the press were criminally prosecuted despite these being a daily occurrence (Pozen 2013). The explanation stems from a complex political communication landscape whereby the government occasionally has incentives to \"plant leaks\" to the media, under the guise of anonymity, in order to further a favorable narrative. Accordingly, under-enforcement allows such informational disclosures to appear \"truthful\" since otherwise their conspicuous exemption from prosecution would signal their lack of credibility to the public. Recent work also demonstrates how repressive authoritarian regimes thrive on an excess, rather than the suppression, of information because a multiplicity of media sources producing competing stories end up creating public uncertainty and \"post-truth\" confusion, thus undermining collective action focused on the political leaders (Wedeen 2015). Balancing these costs and benefits, a selective, as opposed to an all-or-nothing, enforcement of censorship pays off for political leaders and other censors.\n\n# 2.3 \"Segmented\" censorship regimes \n\nIn terms of the \"supply\" of censorship, there is growing evidence that censors prioritize selective tools that ensure the cost-effective suppression of information while maximizing political benefits. In one of the most sophisticated studies of censorship, King et al. (2013) analyzed the censors' real-time activity affecting nearly 1,400 different types of social media outlet in China and concluded that censorship was driven not by an attempt to purge criticism of the regime, but to prevent coordinated collective action. These findings also confirm MacKinnon's (2008) evidence that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) allows certain types of criticism, such as nationalist outrage at foreign powers as well as the use of the internet, to provide feedback loops on public service provision and bolster its legitimacy, while being able to tightly control \"dangerous",
      "10": "activities\" that might threaten its grip on power. When voters have different levels of information, it is possible to achieve the effects of censorship by only targeting media outlets that cater to informed citizens (Prat and Stromberg 2013; Stromberg 2004). Media capture may also occur unevenly due to the existence of inequality, with rich citizens potentially having an incentive to misinform poor citizens. Thus, certain groups with more information and facing fewer restrictions can incentivize politicians to censor outlets that cater to the poor in order to limit political demands for redistribution (Petrova 2007).\n\nBecause of the potential political threat posed by their audience, some types of media are more exposed to suppression. Before 2004, the Ukrainian government of Leonid Kuchma allowed free internet and small circulation newspapers since they had minimum sway in affecting the prospects of the government's survival, while strongly controlling the outlets it considered influential (Dyczok 2004). This relative freedom was also used to deny the existence of censorship. In many developing countries, internet use is highly skewed towards elites that are more likely to support the political status quo, and therefore it is less likely to be censored (Warf 2011). Even across the range of traditional media outlets, such as radio, TV and newspapers, there is evidence that there are benefits derived from selectively allowing \"non-threatening\" outlets to function. In the Russian Federation, despite overwhelmingly controlling the media, Putin left some vocal dissident newspapers open in order to appease the middle class (Applebaum 2014). In post-Soviet environments, in particular, political leaders refrained from using blatant government propaganda, discredited after Communism. Keeping segments of the media to perform real journalism and produce \"believable\" stories turned out to be a more successful agenda-setting strategy in Nazarbaev's Kazakhstan (Schatz 2009). A similar use of so-called positive propaganda in order to",
      "11": "preempt and appease credibility concerns, has been documented in the case of China (Stockmann and Gallagher 2011).\n\n# 2.4. Censorship versus economic media capture \n\nOne of the empirical observations of Besley and Prat, valid at the time of writing, was the end of \"old fashioned preemptive censorship\" that accompanied democratization trends worldwide (Besley and Prat 2006, 720). In fact, most newly adopted constitutions in emerging democracies have explicitly banned censorship. Therefore, in the new world of information, censorship seems to be obsolete, replaced by more subtle forms of media capture via non-coercive means: the expansion of state ownership of media outlets; a high market-concentration of media in the hands of a few oligarchs; selective regulatory favors; and bribery. In transition countries, state control of the media came to replace old censorship (Djankov et al. 2003; Leeson 2008). The Chinese Communist Party was able to control information despite an exponential increase in the number of privately-owned media since the 1970s (Hassid 2008; Stockmann and Gallagher 2011). Often, media capture through economic means is not the explicit action of the government. Many of the largest media firms are owned by private families, with or without connections to governments. Our theory of segmented censorship regimes argues that governments and other entities use a mix of punitive censorship and inducement tools to control information for different audiences. Theoretically and empirically, there is a need to understand whether these tools of media control are employed jointly or in a mutually exclusive manner.\n\nTheoretically, it is not clear whether censorship is still the last resort of censors to control information, despite media capture through non-coercive means, or if it is used for independent",
      "12": "media market segments only. Anecdotal evidence points at both possibilities. In China, despite widespread media capture, the CCP can deem any broadcast or article offensive post publication. Such a \"regime of uncertainty\" induces effective self-censorship across the entire media spectrum, whether public or private, captured or not (Hassid 2008). In Peru, Fujimori and his proxy explicitly bribed some TV channels to fire investigative journalists, thus combining inducement-based capture with direct news suppression (McMillan and Zoido 2004). On the other hand, in Russia, blatant censorship has been used in the relatively independent, non-captured segments of the media market only when going too far. The many intimidation attempts and the brutal murder of wellknown journalist Anna Politkovskaya in 2006 are reminders of the lines that cannot be crossed.\n\nEmpirically, since Besley and Prat's argument, \"old-fashioned\" censorship has increased dramatically as part of the democratic backsliding and security related trends worldwide. All existing metrics of media freedoms, including our data set described below, confirm this reversal empirically. Even established democracies, such as the United States and France, and countries once perceived as regional leaders of democratization, such as Poland and Hungary, have experienced a rapid deterioration of media freedoms since 2001. We collected an original data set capturing all the salient censorship worldwide between 2001 and 2015. Figure 1 plots the data trend and shows a dramatic increase in such events by $231 \\%$, from 219 global episodes in 2001 to 725 in 2014. Figure 2 considers three subjective Freedom House indexes that proxy the main types of media capture tools: legislation that openly sets limits to freedom of reporting (Legal constraints); political interference with information collecting, reporting and dissemination (Political constraints); and economic media capture through positive inducements such as bribes, regulatory favors and market concentration de facto placing media into the hands of the state or government-connected oligarchs (Economic constraints).",

In comparison, the economic constraints indicator - an inducement-based proxy of media capture - remained relatively constant over time (Figure 2). Non-coercive media capture achieved via economic means also seems to affect some outlets more than others, as a function of the political importance of their audiences, in line with our theoretical hypotheses. In one of the most systematic studies of bribes ever conducted, the 'price' that",
      "14": "Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori paid to media outlets in exchange of control over content during the 1990s varied widely, from 1 million dollars for tabloids to 9 million dollars for TV channels. The visibility of the outlet and its reach clearly determined the size of the bribe (McMillan and Zoido 2004).\n\n# 3. Model and hypotheses \n\nOur theoretical model builds directly on Besley and Prat (2006) expanded by Prat and Stromberg (2013). In this original model, ibid. (2006), the authors used a two time period selection game between incumbent politicians, the media, and voters to show that if media control was to be effective all media outlets had to be controlled. Like other extensions of this model (e.g. Trombetta 2017), we show that the existence of different types of audiences can result in heterogeneous levels of censorship co-existing in the same country. As a result, our theoretical extension allows us to explain incidences of no censorship and extensive censorship, but also the conditions under which a \"segmented\" equilibrium may be observed within countries, where different media outlets are unevenly exposed to censorship based on which segments of the market they serve. Similar to some of the ways in which Gehlbach and Sonin (2012), Egorov et al. (2009) and Shadmehr and Bernhardt (2015) depart from the original model, our model also explores how political incumbents may use multiple strategies and tools to realize their goal of controlling a media market.",
      "15": "# 3.1 The baseline model: control in segmented media markets \n\nFollowing closely Besley and Pratt (2006), we use a two-period retrospective selection model with the following steps: ${ }^{3}$\n(i) Nature assigns an incumbent in the first period; (ii) who is one of two types, u $\\in\\{\\mathrm{b}, \\mathrm{g}\\}$, with $\\operatorname{Pr}(\\mathrm{u}=\\mathrm{g})=\\gamma$ where g stands for \"good\" (public goods maximizing) selected with a probability of $\\gamma$, and b stands for \"bad\" (rent $-r-$ maximizing).

However, in reality, outlets may receive a signal multiple times in the first period and some (e.g. daily newspapers) may have an opportunity to report this information multiple times as well, thereby potentially generating unpredictability for an incumbent who does not have a clear strategy for controlling such outlets. Assuming it is possible to know the number of times a signal will be sent in the first period (e.g. major policy announcements), and which outlets may have multiple opportunities to report on these, we can now modify the decision maker's calculus regarding whether or not to control the media through bribery or censorship.

Many observations in our data set in fact suggest that governments do not shy away from exercising control and inflicting censorship on reputable international media outlets or individual journalists.

Additionally, some argue that the suppression of local activist voices, besides entailing lower global legitimacy costs than the blatant censorship of foreign reporters, has also become more important for regime survival (Shirky 2011). Taking into account our model parameters, reputational and logistical costs associated with blatant repression of foreign journalists, and the size of the audience reached by foreign media, we propose the following hypothesis:\n\nH1: Domestic media is more likely to be severely censored than foreign media because, on average, it reaches a wider segment of the population and entails lower transaction costs of punitive censorship.\n\nAccording to our model, the audience size is a crucial determinant of censors' incentives to suppress news. Simply put, governments and other censors economize on cost-effectiveness by",
      "23": "targeting only media that reaches a critical mass of the population, but allow uncontrolled information for niche audience segments. In fact, abundant anecdotal evidence suggests that paradoxically, this is a valid hypothesis even for some of the most repressive autocracies.\n\nThe communist parties of Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia censored selectively, institutionalizing the so-called dual media systems. In Hungary, low-circulation elite publications, local papers, weekly magazines and late-night TV shows were allowed to openly criticize the regime. \"The smaller the circulation of or audience for newspapers or programs, the freer of censorship it became. The larger the audience for a particular medium or message, the more heavily censored it remained\" (Sükösd 2000, 136). In Czechoslovakia, even prior to 1968, cultural weeklies published critical journalism, while daily papers were heavily controlled. The transaction costs of censoring media targeting small, elite audiences was also higher as the official censors \"found difficult to grasp [...] [their] more sophisticated and subtle style\" (Havliček 1982, 22). McMillan and Zoido's (2004) unique study of media capture in Peru clearly demonstrates the hierarchy of political importance of various media outlets. Alberto Fujimori's proxy, Vladimir Montesinos, paid the highest bribes to the most-watched TV channels, while ignoring minor cable TV stations with limited viewership. Paradoxically, Canal N, the only TV channel not bribed because it had monthly fees perceived as too expensive for the majority of the population, was also the channel that broke the news of high-level political corruption which led eventually to the demise of the regime. Similarly, directly speaking to the issue of reach and distribution of newspapers, only one mainstream newspaper and four widely-read tabloids received the bulk of the bribes since they were able to transmit incumbent propaganda to a critical mass of news readers sizeable enough to shape electoral outcomes.",
      "24": "Historical colonial accounts also illustrate the strategic segmentation of media control, with censorship being used only for 'dangerous' types of outlets with mass appeal, and only when their political message had the potential to directly translate into actual dissent. For instance, in the nineteenth century, British censors kept track of Indian media and literature, but allowed it to be free \"even to lament the country's lack of independence\" (Darnton 2014, 132). The nationalist movement following the 1905 partition of Bengal changed their attitude, but forced the colonial censors to adopt selective censorship by targeting only the wide-reach media. Even more than the seditious press, itinerant stage plays became the main target, '(...) for they appeal to persons who are not reached by the newspapers, and excite the nationalist spirits more easily' (Darnton 2014, 142). Recent studies on the electoral influence of the media in OECD countries have also started to explore the effect of news consumption across platforms on information inequality and electoral outcomes (Kennedy and Prat 2017).\n\nH2: Media with larger audience reach is more likely to be targeted by severe punitive censorship than media that reaches smaller audience segments.\n\nThe physical location of the media is also expected to affect the probability of censorship. Diaspora outlets are the only independent news providers or the only media targeting specific groups or minorities in many contexts. During the Cold War, Radio Free Europe, the BBC and Voice of America became major sources of \"truthful\" news for most of the communist bloc. This led former Polish president and Nobel Laureate Lech Walesa to compare the role of diaspora media in democratization to the sun, without which the earth would not exist. Governments, in response, either interfered by attempting to block or jam domestic radio reception or, in rare cases ordered",
      "25": "the intimidation and assault of diaspora journalists. In 1981, Romania's leader, Nicolae Ceauşescu, hired Carlos the Jackal, the notorious international political assassin, to bomb the Munich offices of Radio Free Europe, whose local language broadcasts were popular in an otherwise informationstarved Romania. Despite its crucial importance particularly in opaque non-democratic regimes illustrated by such anecdotes, we anticipate that on average, diaspora sources tend to have smaller audiences and censors entail higher costs when targeting news outlets located abroad rather than domestically.\n\nH3: Because diaspora media reaches smaller segments of the domestic audience, poses less direct political threat and entails higher transaction costs than media located domestically, its probability of being severely censored is likely to be lower.\n\nIn terms of cross-national implications, given that transaction costs are a central feature of the model and that censors face different institutional constraints across political regime types, the logistical, institutional and reputational costs of censorship are likely to see an increase in democratic settings.\n\nH4: Democratic governments are less likely to censor severely, and punitive censorship is generally less likely to occur because of higher transaction costs.\n\nPropositions 2 and 3 of our model go beyond segmentation and imply that transaction costs and audience size also determine the relationship between censorship and inducement-based forms of media capture, such as bribes, regulatory favors and market concentration. Simply put, if the",
      "26": "state or a handful of oligarchs control the consequential media outlets, punitive actions become redundant. Proposition 3 postulates, however, that in the case of media outlets with \"high\" political threat because of audience size, frequency of publication and high transaction costs of censorship, censors are likely to double up the tools of capture in order to insure compliance.\n\nThere is significant evidence that dailies are more difficult to control than other types of newspapers. According to a former head of the radio, TV and print section of the Communist Party Central Committee, even when the Czechoslovak media liberalized following the 1968 Prague Spring, daily newspapers were still kept under heavy censorship as they were considered unpredictable (Havlíček 1982). Similarly, only in 2010 did the military government in Myanmar repeal a law banning daily newspapers; previously, they had only allowed the existence of weeklies because this had meant enough time was available to censors to detect and control dissent.\n\nH5: Punitive censorship and economic media capture act as substitutes in general, but as joint tools of information control for high frequency media outlets with broad audience reach.\n\n# 4. Data \n\nCurrently, there are several cross-national data sets evaluating media freedom. The most widelyused indicators are the Freedom of the Press Index by Freedom House, and the Press Freedom Index, by Reporters without Borders. They both have significant merits and shortcomings in terms of assessing capture. The Freedom of the Press Index takes scores between 0 and 100, with higher values capturing negative evaluations. Despite organizational attempts to apply uniform methodological standards to individual country scores assigned each year, scoring entails",
      "27": "significant subjective judgments (Deutsch Karlekar 2011; Schneider 2014). The comprehensive raw data compiled for its computation nevertheless offer systematic and objective information on punitive actions against individual media outlets. The detailed reports collected for each country and harmonized by the coordinating staff contain factual details on the most salient censorship events taking place during the year of analysis. Beacon for Freedom of Expression, a project of the National Library of Norway, also maintains a global database of country-year individual censorship events.\n\nTo test the implications of our model-namely that various types of media are unequally exposed to coercion because of the size of their audience and the transaction costs entailed by punitive actions-we generated the first original data set of individual censorship events between 2001 and 2015, covering 196 countries and territories. The data set contains 8,979 observations and uses factual information from several sources to code a series of variables of interest on both targets and censors. These include the name of the individual journalist or outlet facing censorship, the type of ownership, the type of censored news, the severity of censorship, the level of censorship, accusations, the frequency of censorship, and many other event-specific characteristics. The Online Appendix includes more information about the construction of our data set.\n\nFirst, by developing our own data as opposed to relying on existing data sets, we aimed to work with objective rather than subjective variables capturing censorship, and at doing so consistently across countries and years. Second, the data set goes beyond government-led punitive actions to record censorship committed by editors, non-government entities such as organized crime networks, extremist religious groups and others. Figure 3 illustrates the extent of censorship by types of censors across 9,000 events.",
      "28": "![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 3: Salient censorship events by censor types (2001-2015)\n\nThird, since we want to capture variations in the severity or magnitude of coercion, our definition of censorship is not limited to extreme human rights abuses such as killing and jail. In fact, we code a full range of acts that count as censorship, from legal suits and fines to accreditation withdrawal, and more severe forms of punishment such as intimidation, assault, death or disappearance. Fourth, this list of individual observations also goes beyond a simple event count and records all the relevant characteristics of the media outlets and individual journalists in order to test our main hypotheses. We are aware that the universe of censorship events worldwide is much larger than the ones we capture. However, the cross-national consistency of coding the most salient censorship events documented by country coders, as well as the cross-validation tests that our data set passed when compared with established data sets of media freedom, give us confidence that we capture representative censorship signals for each country-year.\n\n# 5. Empirical investigation \n\nDependent variables",
      "29": "Our dependent variables of interest are: (1) an ordinal measure capturing the intensity and type of punitive censorship incidents, and (2) an indicator of the total number of incidents of media censorship (count data of salient events) (see Figures 1-5 and Appendix B for descriptive statistics), covering 196 countries between 2001 and 2015. We selected these variables because they proxy two separate but complementary indicators of the prevalence and severity of censorship across countries and over time.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: Distribution of censorship events by their severity (2001-2015)\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 5: Time trends of censorship severity worldwide (2001-2015)",
      "30": "The first dependent variable proxies the severity of censorship by country-year. In terms of our theoretical hypotheses, this event-specific operationalization allows us to interpret the selective choice of censorship targets, if statistically significant, as signals that the censor may want to send to all similar outlets in terms of lines not to be crossed. We constructed an ordinal variable capturing thirteen categories of censorship actions, grouped by the consequences for targets, and ranging from lawsuits and fines all the way to jailing, death and disappearance (Figure 4). In our data set, intimidation, assault and jail are the most numerous censorship actions. The second dependent variable aggregates all punitive censorship events, in total and by types, by country-year into a panel format. Unlike the number of total censorship events that displays a clear and steep upward trend between 2001 and 2015 (Figure 1), the mean severity of censorship oscillated more sharply, exhibiting a recent increase (Figure 5).\n\n# Independent variables \n\nTo test the hypotheses of censors' selective control of different media market segments based on the audience size and transaction costs, the independent variables of interest aim at operationalizing several dimensions: (1) whether or not the targeted media outlet is foreign or domestic, stemming from the assumption that domestic constituencies are more important for the survival of the leader, and that there are higher transaction and reputation costs involved in repressing foreign media; (2) whether the media outlet is located in the capital city, in the regions or abroad; (3) whether the media outlet distributes or broadcasts information to a large or narrow audience depending on its type. Empirically, to assign meaningful values to an ordinal scale that accurately capture the size of the audience, we use the most recent Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes and Trends surveys asking respondents where they get their national and international news primarily from. While there is variation in terms of the audience size reached by each type",
      "31": "of media by country-year, television programs lead worldwide as the primary source of news, followed by radio, print, and remotely, by online sources. This empirical distribution confirms previous findings suggesting that especially in developing contexts with low internet penetration and literacy rates, online and print media mostly addresses urban elites, whereas TV and radio are the most politically consequential media platforms because they can reach the broadest and most diverse news consumers (Keefer and Khemani 2014). Accordingly, based on individual surveys on news consumption and insights from the theoretical literature, we created an ordinal variable ranging from 1 to 4 , with lower values indicating a larger audience reachable by the outlet. TV is coded as 1 ; radio as 2 ; printed newspapers and magazines 3 ; and online 4 . As an identification strategy, we take into account the variation in country-year specific audience sizes for each media type and use it as an instrumental variable for our reach measure. We employ several two least square regression (2SLS) analyses with the actual country-specific survey results regarding the audience size for each type of media. The instrument is very strong, with a large F-statistic, and the results of the 2SLS regressions hold across multiple specifications, confirming that the audience size drives up the severity of censorship via Media reach as an endogenous regressor. The Online Appendix also includes robustness checks with media supply used jointly with demand to construct the instrument.\n\nFor print media in particular, we also generated a measure of the frequency of publication (daily, weekly, biweekly, triweekly, monthly, bimonthly and quarterly). Other independent variables of interest include the gender of the journalist/actor being censored. In addition to our event-specific variables, a large number of country-level controls are included in the analysis: the economic concentration of the media market; the legal environment in which the media operates; the level of democracy; ethno-linguistic fragmentation; public sector corruption; the composition",
      "32": "and size of a government's majority in the legislature; the length of executive tenure; per capita income; population; country fixed effects; time fixed effects; and, where gender is used as an independent variable of interest, the proportion of women in the national legislature.\n\nFor the time series panel format, our baseline specification can be written as:\n\n$$\ny_{i t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} x_{i t}+\\beta_{2} z_{i t}+\\beta_{3} \\theta_{t}+\\beta_{4} \\vartheta_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i t}\n$$\n\nwhere $y_{i t}$ is the incidence of censorship in general and by types in country $i$ and time period $t ; \\mathrm{x}$ is a vector of news demand (percentage of survey respondents that get news from each media type), z is a vector of country-year variables that help us distinguish between types of media capture, and control for levels of democracy and economic development, $\\theta$ is a time fixed effect, and $\\vartheta$ is a country fixed effect. For the censorship event-specific analyses, we present both ordered probit analyses with country and year fixed effects, as well as Hierarchical Linear Model analyses with three levels (country, year and censorship events).\n\n# 6. Results \n\nTables 1-3 report our findings when using the severity of censorship as the dependent variable. For robustness, we employ various types of statistical models, control variables and postestimation tests. Table 1 shows Ordered Probit results with country and year fixed effects. Since we argue in the theoretical section that media market segmentation should carry a similar logic for all censors, we aim at generalizability and work with the entire sample.",

      "36": "Virtually all independent variables of interest remain statistically significant despite variations in the regression models used, as well as when using an instrumental variable for media reach. As expected theoretically, domestic media is associated with more severe forms of censorship vis-à-vis foreign outlets, and is highly significant. Foreign ownership increases the probability that censorship takes the least severe forms with about $4 \\%$ on average. Overall, our statistical analysis demonstrates that the form censorship takes is significantly more severe in the case of domestic media since this is the primary source of information for a majority of the population and the transaction costs of censorship are lower.\n\nWe also tested a different, yet related, measure of media location. We constructed a variable capturing the actual physical location of news production and dissemination. The three conceptual categories for location are the capital city, sub-national regions and abroad. In terms of severity of censorship, the statistically significant result we identify is that media outlets disseminating news in the country are significantly more at risk of serious censorship consequences than outlets broadcasting or publishing abroad. Broadcasting from abroad reduces the probability of harsh censorship by about $3 \\%$ with control variables kept at mean. This finding has particular relevance for non-democratic contexts where, because of a subdued domestic press, diaspora media has taken the front seat in providing a counter-narrative to government propaganda. On average, we find evidence that during our period of analysis, media outlets functioning inside the country are more exposed to censorship than diaspora media, and we believe that this is a function of the size of the domestic audience reached from these two types of location. We also find that in our full sample where we include all censors, media outlets located in the capital city are less at risk of censorship than those situated in other regions of the country. We do not report",
      "37": "this result here, but interpret it as capturing the political geography of media intimidation coming from terrorist groups, organized crime networks or paramilitary groups and militias.\n\nIn terms of audience size and its political consequences we constructed two variables. Media reach codes the outlets subject to censorship according to audience size, from TV (1), radio (2), print (3) to narrower segments of news consumers via online platforms (4). Model 2 in Tables 1, 2, and 3 shows that the size of the audience triggers different intensities of censorship. Mass (non-elite) media, such as television, a key medium in many developing countries, radio or newspapers are subject to significantly harsher censorship vis-à-vis more specialist or elite media outlets such as online news platforms. A change in type of media from TV to internet news reduces the chances of severe censorship by around $10 \\%$ on average (Figure 6).\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure 6: Predictive margins of Media reach on the probability of censorship severity\n\nTable 4 presents the results of two least squared analyses when the Media reach variable is instrumented with the Pew survey data on outlet-specific news consumption.",

      "39": "The instrument is strong and the alternative specifications of the Media reach variable render highly significant results and stable coefficients.

Our three categories of publications (daily, weekly, and less frequent than weekly) allow us to verify whether frequency, as an opportunity for media outlets to send multiple signals to their audience, despite higher transaction costs for censors",
      "40": "also have an impact on punitive risks. Model 3 in Tables 1-3 suggest that the severity of censorship is not related to the frequency of publication.\n\nModel 5 in Tables 1-3 also shows that women media professionals are subject to less severe censorship than their male counterparts. In order to insure that we do not capture the statistical effects of a country-specific generalized gender bias, we control for the percentage of women in national parliaments. This result might be explained by gender discrepancies in the media, with males being overrepresented in investigative journalism and therefore more exposed to censorship, or by the general attitude of censors with respect to both the level of perceived threat and the level of severity that can be applied to different genders according to country-specific social norms. Given the importance of gender in public policy making, this finding deserves further in-depth exploration.\n\nIn line with our theoretical expectations, the only country-level variable that yields some significant results is the level of democracy. We use two alternative measures: first, the HaddeniusTeorell indicator of democracy computed as the mean of Freedom House and Polity IV scores for a general measure; and a more specific variable capturing political interference with media work, Political constraints, computed by Freedom of the Press. We find some evidence that democracies exhibit less severe punishments when engaging in censorship activities, despite the fact that even established democracies censor information. In fact, while the degree of political constraints to press freedom is robust across all models, our democracy indicators are only marginally significant. An interesting non-finding also suggests that economic media capture via market concentration, bribery, or regulatory favors, does not have any significant effect on the severity of censorship. The same interpretation applies to the effect of legal constraints.",
      "41": "For a second set of analyses using total numbers of salient censorship events, we transformed our data set into a country-panel format in order to be able to test the factors leading to the magnitude of censorship, and not only to its intensity. Table 5 shows the marginal changes in the magnitude of censorship events induced by demand (news consumption). Robustness checks included in the online appendix also test supply factors (total numbers of radio stations, TV channels, and print publications). For print media and TV, a one unit increase in audience size triggers significant increases in censorship events (around $2 \\%$ and $10 \\%$ respectively), whereas supply factors are insignificant. These results need to be interpreted with caution given that we have a smaller sample size with reliable data on the supply and demand of news compared to the salient censorship events data set, but overall they strongly confirm the importance of the audience size in censors' decision to control information.",

      "44": "substitutable. Overall, we find strong evidence of antagonistic incentives in media markets. Both political and legal constraints lead to a higher number of censorship events, validating the construction principle of our data set, whereas economic constraints and public corruption lower the overall number. In other words, it seems that censors that are able to control the media through bribes or favorable ownership structures refrain from using ex-post coercion, as information control occurs ex-ante. This finding also points at a normative nuance when interpreting the lack of censorship in a society. The fact that the government does not conspicuously punish is not equivalent to the freedom of the media since forms of economic control might insure the total domination of a pro-government narrative.\n\nModels 3 to 6 of Table 6 also look into the substitutability effect depending on the different segments of the market identified as being politically consequential. Indeed, the number of censorship events affecting foreign outlets or reporting located abroad is inversely correlated with economic constraints, pointing at the hypothesized mechanism. If the media market is controlled domestically through economic inducements, there is no need to censor less threatening media alternatives. Since domestic media is the most consequential for our theory of market segmentation, we also decided to analyze two of the types of media with wide reach: TV broadcasting and daily newspapers. The results are more nuanced. The market for TV broadcasters seems to react to either positive or negative inducements from censors (Model 4 Table 6, and Model 1 Table 7), whereas in the case of newspapers with a daily distribution, coercive tools of control such as censorship seem to co-exist with non-coercive inducements for news control (Model 5 Table 6, and Model 2 Table 7).\n\nTable 7: Alternative mechanisms of media capture by types of targets (GLM fractional logit models, country and year fixed effects)",

In many places around the world, they are the main sources of investigative journalism and have a crucial spill-over effect on other media platforms despite a decreasing trend in direct readership.\n\n# 7. Conclusion",
      "46": "This paper has asked whether the censorship strategies employed by censors vary across individual targets, and whether punishment via censorship occurs when other forms of media capture through bribes or other economic inducements fail. Our leading theoretical hypothesis is that censors engage in a cost-benefit calculus of censorship targets based on the political threat posed by the audience size and transaction costs. This balance leads to economizing punitive censorship, by confining it only to segments of the media market that reach politically important constituencies, and only when economic inducements cannot effectively control information.\n\nIn order to test our theory of market segmentation, we constructed the first global data set that captures a full set of characteristics of salient punitive censorship events affecting individual media outlets and professionals, in 196 countries between 2001 and 2015. We found that, on average, foreign media, as well as outlets operating from abroad, are less exposed to censorship since on average they are less politically consequential than domestic media and entail higher transaction costs of suppression. One of the most interesting results suggests that the risk of being censored is strongly correlated with the audience reach of the media type. Even when controlling for the level of economic development that captures the prevalent types of media in a country, TV broadcasting, radio, and print are significantly more likely to be the targets of severe forms of censorship than media accessible mostly to elites, such as online news platforms, blogs or freelance journalism. The fact that traditional media reaches a wider audience renders censors more vulnerable to the perils of potential political dissent triggered by news.\n\nThe paper also investigated whether censors use different media capture tools simultaneously or in a substitutable manner. Besley and Prat's (2006) seminal article suggests that coercion has been replaced with economic inducements, such as bribes or regulatory rewards for outlets. We show empirically that censorship is back, mirroring a general trend in democratic",
      "47": "backsliding and security threats worldwide. Further, it is employed mostly when and where media market concentration and bribes fail. We provide some evidence that the segments of the market that are more dominated through the use of economic pressure, or that carry less political weight, are less likely to face straightforward coercive action. We also showed that there is a difference between different forms of media, with newspapers of daily circulation still facing censorship despite the presence of the economic control of media markets. This situation needs further investigation, but might point at coercion as a last resort given the high transaction costs entailed by the unpredictability of rapidly produced and disseminated information.",

For audiences, the only information citizens receive in each segment of the market is the signal (from their respective elite or mass media outlets). As audiences are unambiguously worse off by supporting a bad type incumbent, not supporting such an incumbent is a strictly dominant strategy if signal $=b$ is observed. There is also no PSPBEW",
      "57": "in which the incumbent is not supported (by either or both the elite and non-elite audiences) if signal $=\\emptyset$. As this outcome would be impossible because the incumbent would not suppress information (to either elite or non-elite audiences), the posterior when citizens observe signal $=$ $\\emptyset$ would therefore be strictly greater than $\\gamma$.\n\nNow, consider the strategic interaction between the incumbent and the outlets. It is easy to demonstrate that in every PSPBEW, an informed outlet in a given segment of the media market accepts $t_{i}>\\alpha_{s}$ and rejects $t_{i}<\\alpha_{s}$. First, the revenue of $i$ cannot be higher than $\\alpha_{s}$. Thus, in any equilibrium $i$ must accept offers above $\\alpha_{s}$ (bribe) or will lose the capacity to report the story (censorship). Secondly, in equilibrium the incumbent buys off/censors either all the informed outlets in a given segment of the market or none of them. Suppose that outlet $i$ in segment $s$ accepts an offer/receives a censorship-inducing cost strictly below $\\alpha_{s}$. In this case all outlets in the segment of the market in question are controlled. But then, if outlet $i$ rejects the offer/breaks the story, it is the only outlet to break the news (to elite or non-elite citizens) and she gets $\\alpha$ : which is a contradiction.\n\nThe fact that the incumbent only gains utility from controlling the mass media means that the elite segment of the media is never bribed as doing so yields a lower level of rent for the incumbent $r-\\sum_{\\mathrm{i} \\in \\mathrm{I}} \\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{im}}>\\mathrm{r}-\\sum_{\\mathrm{i} \\in \\mathrm{I}} \\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{im}}-\\sum_{\\mathrm{i} \\in \\mathrm{I}} \\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{ic}}$ without increasing her chances in remaining in office and enjoying period two rents. The fact that outlets accept/are effectively censored if $t_{i}>\\alpha_{s}$ and reject/are not effectively censored if $t_{i}<\\alpha_{s}$ means that in every PSPBEW the incumbent will: (I) control the mass the media if $\\left(n_{m} \\tau_{m} \\alpha_{m}\\right)<r$ and at least one outlet in the mass media has received a signal about the incumbent's bad type; and (IV) does not control the mass media $\\left(n_{m} \\tau_{m} \\alpha_{m}\\right)>r$.",

Utilizing a firm survey dataset from Vietnam, this paper first calculates firm-level markups for manufacturing firms and then analyzes the impact of foreign direct investment and foreign ownership on firm markups. Overall, the findings show that increases in the presence of foreign firms in a given industry are associated with decreases in markups in that industry, despite foreign\nfirms individually charging higher markups on average than their domestic competitors. The findings further show that while the markups of both foreign- and domestic-owned private firms tend to decrease with greater foreign direct investment, state-owned enterprises may be relatively insulated from foreign direct investment driven competitive pressures. These results are robust to the inclusion or exclusion of potential outliers and the potential non-random selection of firms acquired by foreign investors.\n\nThis paper is a product of the Finance, Competitiveness and Innovation Global Practice.

      "3": "# I. Introduction \n\nRobust competition is core to well-functioning markets that work for development. Pressures from existing and prospective competitors force firms to lower prices, increase quality, and innovate new offerings, in turn benefitting consumer welfare. At the macroeconomic level, competition boosts productivity growth, fosters labor reallocation, and favors high-productivity firms. In the absence of such competition, firms are able to extract economic rents by leveraging their market power to raise prices, in turn hurting consumers and decreasing demand for labor (De Loecker, Eeckhout, \\& Unger, 2020).\n\nConcerns over market power and competition have increased in recent years. Over the past several years, scholars have documented an increase in the firms' market power across countries and regions. For instance, De Loecker and Eeckhout (2020) find that the aggregate global markup has increased from close to 1.15 in 1980 to around 1.6 in 2016, leading to distributional consequences in terms of larger profits and lower labor shares. Moreover, recent challenges posed by the rise of digital platforms and a wave of pandemic-driven bankruptcies by smaller firms may also worsen the trend of increased market power in the future (Akcigit et al., 2021). Enriching policy makers' and researchers' understanding of the drivers of and barriers to competition is thus critical to development.\n\nGiven that foreign investment is a key driver of economic growth in developing economies and the recent trend of rising global markups, it is critical to evaluate the effect of FDI on the markups of host economies and the consequences for consumer welfare. Theoretically, the impacts of FDI on market power are ambiguous because the presence of multinational enterprises (MNEs) could have conflicting effects on incumbent firms' market power: FDI could lower prices due to increased competitive pressure, but MNEs themselves may possess higher market power if they possess significant economies of scale to undercut local firms, force firm exit, and eventually reduce competition. To date, data availability has limited existing studies to advanced economies, and conclusions have been widely heterogeneous based on the country of interest.\n\nTo address this gap, this paper evaluates the effect of FDI on market power within industries using firmlevel panel data for Vietnam. We first apply the methodological work by De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) to estimate firm-level production functions and compute markups. Then, we estimate the impact of FDI on markups via a difference-in-differences estimation. We also analyze the impact of foreign ownership on individual firms' markups by looking at differences in markups between foreign- and domestic-owned firms and analyzing the impact of acquisition and divestment by foreign investors.\n\nOur findings suggest that the presence of MNEs in a given industry decreases markups in that industry. We find that a 10 percent increase in foreign-owned firms' share of output within a given two-digit manufacturing sector is associated with a 0.4 to 1.2 percentage point decrease in the ratio of price to marginal cost. This pro-competitive finding holds despite MNEs charging higher markups on average than domestic competitors. Furthermore, the results show that, while the markups of both foreign- and domestic-owned private firms tend to decrease with greater FDI presence, state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may be relatively insulated from FDI-driven competitive pressures.\n\nOur contribution is twofold. First, our work contributes to the scarce literature that evaluates the effects of FDI on market power in host countries, especially low- and middle-income contexts. Most country-level studies on this topic rely on accounting-based price-cost margins, concentration, or entry and exit dynamics to measure market power and focus on high-income settings (Abolhassani \\& Danakol, 2019;",
      "4": "Bottasso \\& Sembenelli, 2001; Chung, 2001; Forte \\& Sarmento, 2012). While some recent studies compute firm-level markups following De Loecker and Warzynski (2012), many such studies are cross-country in nature, raising questions of comparability across contexts (Bitzer \\& Görg, 2009; Rutkowski, 2006; Weche, 2018). Our paper builds upon this base by analyzing economic markups in a developing country setting.\n\nSecond, we explore heterogeneity in the effect of foreign presence on individual firm markups depending on the firm's ownership, specifically looking at potential differences between foreign-owned firms, domestic-owned private firms, and SOEs. The focus on SOEs in particular is critical to developing country contexts such as Vietnam, where SOEs play a major role in the economy (Dang, Nguyen, \\& TaghizadehHesary, 2020). SOEs may distort competitive environments due to their complex ownership structures, weak management, and unclear financial and debt obligations. Thus, studying the potential (or lack thereof) for FDI-driven gains in SOE productivity and efficiency is of particular interest.\n\nIn the next section, we summarize the related literature on FDI and market power. Then, we discuss the methodology in Section III before presenting the database and descriptive statistics in Section IV. Next, we report the results and robustness tests in Sections V and VI, respectively. Finally, we provide policy implications and discuss the future research agenda in Section VII.\n\n# II. Literature review \n\nConventional theory proposes two potentially conflicting outcomes of FDI in developing economies. One claims that the presence of foreign firms should increase the level of competition and, therefore, lower aggregate market power. Another suggests that foreign firms will have significant economies of scale and consequently undercut local firms, potentially raising market power for foreign firms (Amiti \\& Khandelwal, 2013; Khandelwal, Schott, \\& Wei, 2013; Nocke \\& Yeaple, 2008; Norbäck \\& Persson, 2007).\n\nThere is extensive literature exploring the role of firm market power and the macroeconomic implications, but relatively few studies have explored this relationship in the context of FDI and the associated entry of multinational enterprises, especially in developing markets. ${ }^{2}$ The majority of country-level studies exploring the impact of FDI on market power and associated outcomes focus on advanced economies and come to conflicting conclusions. Barrios, Gorg, and Strobl (2005) examine FDI in Ireland and find that the concentration of foreign firms in a given market harms net entry, implying that FDI may have a negative impact on competition and, ultimately, consumers. Similarly, utilizing data from the Netherlands, Abolhassani and Danakol (2019) find that FDI increases concentration by raising the minimum efficient scale. In contrast, Forte and Sarmento (2012) and Bottasso and Sembenelli (2001) find that the presence of foreign firms reduces concentration when looking at Portugal and Italy, respectively. In the United States, Chung (2001) finds that FDI decreases markups at the industry level, with a 10 percent increase in foreign company sales leading to a 2.4 percent reduction in markups. A common theme among these studies is the authors' emphasis that the results may be limited to the specific country observed and that additional research is needed to fully understand the impacts of FDI on market power.\n\nCross-country studies by Rutkowski (2006), Weche (2018), and Bitzer and Gorg (2009) find some evidence that FDI increases competitiveness and reduces markups, but the results vary across countries, with some experiencing lower markups and others experiencing higher markups. Additionally, when there is\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Studies of the impact of rising market power such as De Loecker, Eeckhout, \\& Unger (2020) have identified key implications such as declining labor market dynamism as well as falling labor and capital shares.",
      "5": "statistical significance, it is often weak and depends on model specifications. One possible explanation for the mixed results offered by Weche (2018) is that the positive spillovers and competitive impacts of FDI cancel each other out or vary in magnitude across countries.\n\nIn one of the few studies focusing on a developing economy, Sivadasan (2009) explores the relaxation of FDI restrictions in India and finds a significant long-term negative impact on output prices, possibly indicating higher levels of competition from FDI. He also finds a positive impact on productivity and decomposes the productivity gains to show that they are likely the result of technological adoption and not shifts in market power toward more productive firms. Together, these findings indicate that FDI in developing economies may increase competition and reduce markups while still having positive technological spillovers. In another study of the Indian market, Stiebale and Vencappa (2018) analyze how acquisitions by domestic and international firms have differential impacts on target firms and product markets. They find that acquisitions by foreign firms lead to increases in quality and markups as well as a fall in quality-adjusted prices. This suggests that foreign acquisitions increase markups of acquired firms, but positive spillovers in quality are passed to consumers at the same time. The findings suggests that the quality effect dominates the markup effect but the authors do not rigorously test this conclusion in aggregate terms.\n\nFinally, Forte (2016) provides a comprehensive survey of the literature pertaining to FDI's impact on concentration as well as its impact on domestic firm entry and exit. She finds mixed results regarding concentration with different studies finding both positive and negative impacts of FDI. When looking at domestic firm entry, she finds a positive relationship but observes mixed results around exit and survival. Her study outlines vast heterogeneity between countries and methodologies that have been observed in the literature and highlights the importance of further research, particularly in developing countries. The remainder of this paper attempts to address this gap by examining the impact of FDI on market power within the developing country context of Vietnam.\n\n# III. Methodology \n\nThis paper focuses on markups as our primary measure of market power. . ${ }^{3}$ For the purposes of this paper, we modify this expression slightly to $P / M C$ (price divided by marginal cost) in line with De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) due to the ability to estimate this measure using firm-level data, but the interpretation remains the same. In conceptual terms, markups measure the ability of firms to exert their market power and price goods above the socially optimal outcome of prices equaling marginal costs under perfect competition. Thus, positive markups indicate market power and loss of social welfare. Nevertheless, in practice, firms may also charge prices above marginal costs in response to other incentives different than market power. For instance, firms may increase prices to cover high fixed costs, leading to higher markups in the market.\n\nMarket power can also be assessed by concentration measures such as the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) or firm entry and exit data, which are commonplace among legal practitioners and regulators in part\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ The standard definition of markups is commonly termed the Lerner index as it is built upon the work of Lerner (1934). In practice, there are certain reasons why the Lerner index may not be a completely perfect measure of market power, but in general it provides a closer measure than more indirect approaches of studying market power such as measures of concentration. For more information, refer to the discussion in Elzinga and Mills (2011).",
      "6": "because they are less data-intensive. ${ }^{4}$ We choose markups as our proxy to market power instead of concentration measures because markups acknowledge the role of both output and cost information in leading market power, while measurements such as HHI only use one dimension, particularly revenues. Additionally, we do not analyze the firm's entry and exit barriers because we do not trust firms to enter and exit our data set in the years in which they actually enter and exit the market, based on an analysis of the correspondence between listed founding dates and years of entry into the data set.\n\nThe first step of our methodology involves estimating markups, which are the dependent variable across all our regression specifications. We compute markups following the method proposed by De Loecker and Warzynski (2012). ${ }^{5}$ This method uses optimal input demand conditions from the standard cost minimization problem and includes a control function for unobserved input prices and a routine to recover the allocation of inputs. The empirical approach relies on the insight that the output elasticity of a variable production factor free of adjustment costs is only equal to its expenditure share in total revenue when price equals the marginal cost of production. Therefore, any divergence between an input's revenue share and its output elasticity is a firm's markup if competition is imperfect. It is important to mention that De Loecker and Warzynski's (2012) methodology provides consistent estimates of the output elasticities while allowing some inputs to face adjustments costs.\n\nIn practice, firm-level production functions are first estimated via a two-stage procedure. The first stage involves generating OLS estimates of output (defined as deflated turnover), assuming both Cobb-Douglas and translog gross output production functions. We define capital as deflated total assets, labor as number of employees, and materials as deflated cost of goods sold less labor cost. The residuals are then captured to proxy for unobserved productivity shocks. The residuals from the first stage are plugged into the second stage, which utilizes GMM to identify production function coefficients. Finally, in line with De Loecker and Warzynski (2012), markup estimates are derived by taking the ratio of output elasticity of materials to materials' cost share of revenue.\n\nOnce we finish estimating markups, our main empirical strategy involves estimating the following equation to analyze the impact of FDI on markups:\n\n$$\nY_{i, s, t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} F D I_{s, t-1}+\\beta_{2} E X P_{s, t-1}+\\beta_{4} M N E_{i, s, t}+D_{i}+T_{t}+\\epsilon_{i, s, t}\n$$\n\nwhere $Y_{i, s, t}$ denotes markup; $F D I_{s, t-1}$ represents foreign-owned firms' share of output in the relevant two-digit sector; $E X P_{s, t-1}$ is the export share of turnover in the relevant two-digit sector; $M N E_{i, s, t}$ is a dummy variable reflecting whether a firm is foreign-owned; $D_{i}$ denotes firm fixed effects, $T_{t}$ denotes year fixed effects; $i$ indexes firms; $s$ indexes two-digit sectors as defined by the Vietnam Standard Industrial Classification System (VSIC); and $t$ indexes years. Lagged explanatory variables are used in response to endogeneity concerns. Results from estimations of (1) are reported in Table 2.\n\nThe presence of firm and time fixed effects allows us to control for time-invariant, firm-level unobservables and nonlinear, firm-invariant time trends, effectively making $\\beta_{1}$ a difference-in-differences\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Wnder certain set of assumptions, concentration measures may suggest changes in the firms' ability to charge higher markups (Cowling \\& Waterson, 1976).\n    ${ }^{5}$ Other methods of estimating markups have been used such as in Diewert and Fox (2008), where markups are calculated as revenues divided by total costs. The main drawback to this method is its requirement for data on capital costs which are rarely available. The method from De Loecker and Warzynski (2012) does have a drawback in its need to estimate production functions but is better suited to the available data in this study.",
      "7": "estimate of the impact of FDI presence on markups. In addition, $E X P_{s, t-1}$ is included to control for the export intensity of a given sector. Sectors that primarily serve global export markets may have lower average markups as they must be competitive globally, although the relationship may be reversed at the individual firm level within sectors because firms' productivity-and therefore markups-may increase through \"learning by exporting\" (Dauda, Nyman, \\& Cassim, 2019; De Loecker \\& Warzynski, 2012). ${ }^{6}$ Similarly, including $M N E_{i, s, t}$ allows us to control for firm-level MNE status, which may impact markups through MNEs' increased productivity or brand premia that MNEs are able to charge.\n\nIn addition, in further estimations, we account for differential impacts based on export intensity of the sectors in which firms operate. Additional FDI within an export-intensive sector may have a smaller impact on firms' markups in the host country because firms are already competing with producers around the world. In other words, they are likely already in competition with MNEs, and the significance of MNE entrants into the host country is likely to be smaller in global market share terms. Conversely, firms within a domestic market-oriented sector are more likely to be in direct competition with MNE entrants as the domestic market is served by firms operating in the host country and imports. To account for this possibility, we estimate the following equation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\nY_{i, s, t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{0} F D I_{s, t-1}+\\beta_{2} E X P_{s, t-1}+\\beta_{3} F D I_{s, t-1} * E X P_{s, t-1}+\\beta_{3} M N E_{i, s, t} \\\\\n+D_{i}+T_{t}+\\epsilon_{i, s, t}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nTo examine differences between the markups of foreign-owned and domestic-owned firms, we estimate the following equation:\n\n$$\nY_{i, s, t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} M N E_{i, s, t}+X_{i, s, t-1}+D_{s, t}+\\omega_{i, s, t}\n$$\n\nwhere $X_{i, s, t-1}$ denotes a vector of lagged firm-level controls (typically total factor productivity of revenue, logged output, and logged capital) and $D_{s, t}$ denotes sector-time fixed effects. $\\beta_{1}$ can be interpreted as the difference in markups between foreign-owned and domestic firms after controlling for $X_{i, s, t-1}$ and sectortime trends. Results from estimations of (3) are reported in Table 4.\n\nHowever, estimations of (3) only provide a view of differences between foreign- and domestic-owned firms, but they do not necessarily analyze the impact of foreign ownership per se as they do not control for firm-level unobservables. Thus, we further analyze the impact of foreign control by estimating the following equation:\n\n$$\nY_{i, s, t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} M N E_{i, s, t}+X_{i, s, t-1}+D_{i}+T_{t}+\\omega_{i, s, t}\n$$\n\nwhere, once again, $D_{i}$ denotes firm fixed effects, and $T_{t}$ denotes year fixed effects. This difference-indifferences approach with firm-level fixed effects allows us to interpret $\\beta_{1}$ as the impact of foreign control as $\\beta_{1}$ reflects the impact on markups of firms changing ownership due to acquisitions by foreign firms (if the sample is restricted to firms that started domestic-owned in our sample period), divestments by foreign firms (if the sample is restricted to firms that started foreign-owned), or both (if the regression is run on the full sample). Results from estimations of (4) are reported in Table 5.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ Data constraints prevent us from analyzing firm-level export status as the data for firm-level exports are incomplete in terms of coverage across years.",
      "8": "# IV. Data \n\nThis study uses a firm-level unbalanced panel dataset from the Vietnam Economic Survey over the 20092016 period. The Vietnam Economic Survey is conducted annually by the Government of Vietnam's General Statistics Office (GSO) and covers all manufacturing and services enterprises in the country with more than 20 employees and a representative sample of firms with fewer than 20 employees. Tax codes were used as a time-invariant identifier of firms.\n\nSeveral steps were taken to clean the data prior to analysis. First, Only manufacturing firms were considered for analysis given that the cost of goods sold (COGS) is more easily interpretable as materials costs within manufacturing than in services. In addition, firms with missing or invalid financial data (namely turnover, total assets, cost of goods sold, and employment) were excluded, as were firms with invalid or missing tax codes. Third, Micro-firms with fewer than 10 employees were excluded as production function estimation is not reliable at such low levels of employment. Finally, firms with outlier or unreasonable markup estimates (less than zero or over three) were removed from the data set. ${ }^{7}$ The resulting data set thus includes 117,363 observations with markup estimates across 35,659 firms over the 2010-2014 period and 2016. Information from 2015 was excluded due to incomplete cost of goods sold data, while markup estimates could not be made for 2009 (the earliest year of the data set) as markup estimates rely on lagged data (see discussion in the methodology section).\n\nIn addition, the data from the Vietnam Economic Survey were supplemented with further national and global data for analytical purposes. Input and output deflator data at the Vietnam Standard Industrial Classification (VSIC) two-digit level were sourced from the GSO, while input-output tables for Vietnam were sourced from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Finally, fixed capital deflators were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).\n\n## Descriptive statistics\n\nTable 1 displays summary statistics of various firm characteristics used for markup estimation and measures of markups and firm profitability. For firm $i$ in year $t$, Output $_{i, s, t}$ is defined as deflated revenue; Employment $_{i, s, t}$ denotes total employees at the end of year; Capital $_{i, s, t}$ denotes deflated total assets at the beginning of year; Materials $_{i, s, t}$ denotes deflated cost of goods sold (COGS); $M N E_{i, s, t}$ is a dummy variable equal to one if the firm is foreign-owned; $S O E_{i, s, t}$ is a dummy variable equal to one if the firm is state-owned; and $Y_{i, s, t}$ is markup defined as price divided by marginal cost. According to the legal information reported in the survey, a firm is considered foreign-owned when it is a joint venture between foreign owners and other private proprietors or is $100 \\%$ foreign-owned.\n\nFirm-year observations vary widely in terms of their size whether measured in terms of revenue, employees, capital, or materials cost. Average estimated markups are greater than one, signifying that\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ Negative markups are implausible as they require prices or marginal costs to be negative. The high-end cutoff of three was selected as it implies very high gross margins in excess of 75 percent that are seldom seen in practice at this level of aggregation. While this cutoff is somewhat arbitrary, we show in Section VI that our results are robust to different levels of cutoffs. Overall, such outliers account for 2 percent of markup estimates assuming a CobbDouglas production function and under 1 percent of estimates assuming a translog production function. Outliers correspond to 1 percent or fewer of all translog estimates, although they are somewhat more common for within individual sectors for Cobb-Douglas estimates, with a maximum of 11 percent for the leather goods sector.",

Figure 1 displays the evolution of foreign-owned firms' share of industry output between 2010 and 2016 by two-digit manufacturing sector. The repair and maintenance, machinery manufacturing, and textiles sectors saw the largest increases in foreign presence over the 2010-2016 period, while the motor vehicles subsector saw the largest-albeit still modest-decrease. Figure 2 displays the evolution of mean markups by two-digit manufacturing sector between 2010 and 2016. Average markups increased across most two-digit sectors between 2010 and 2016, especially for motor vehicles and apparel. In contrast, the tobacco subsector saw a decrease in average markups. The increase in markups over time does not necessarily imply that firms have more market power. For instance, an increase in fixed costs or new product varieties may increase markups without necessarily implying higher profits. Unfortunately, due to data restrictions associated with the firm's cost structure, we cannot perform further analysis of profits. Therefore, we limit our conclusions to the rise in markups without emphasizing the potential market power rises.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ In the data, we define SOEs as firms which have $>50$ percent state ownership based on their legal form.

Our preferred specifications in Columns 3-4 estimate (2) to account for heterogeneous impacts based on the export intensity of the sector for the theoretical reasons outlined previously. Under our preferred specifications, we find a negative and statistically significant coefficient on $F D I_{s, t-1}$, regardless of whether a Cobb-Douglas or translog production function is assumed. In other words, greater FDI intensity is associated with decreases in markups in a given sector. This result is largely in line with the findings of Chung (2001), Sivadasan (2009), Forte and Sarmento (2012) and Bottasso and Sembenelli (2001). Specifically, we find the point estimate implies that a 10-percentage point increase in FDI presence is associated with a 1.5 to 2.6 percentage point reduction in the ratio of price to marginal cost in sectors that sell entirely to domestic markets. Similarly, the reduction on markups due to an increase in FDI of the same magnitude in the median sector of the export distribution is between 0.04 to 1.2 percentage points. The coefficient on $F D I_{s, t-1}$ is also negative across estimations of (1) that exclude the interaction term, although they are not always statistically significant.\n\nTable 2.

The coefficients on the interaction term between FDI intensity and export intensity are generally positive in Table 2 and marginally statistically significant in Column 3, while the coefficient in Column 4 just misses the threshold for statistical significance. In addition, the coefficient on the export intensity term is negative across all specifications and at least marginally statistically significant in all but one specification. Taken together, these results suggest that FDI is associated with reduced markups primarily in domestic market-oriented sectors, potentially because firms in export-oriented sectors already face competition from producers around the world, making the contribution of MNE entrants to competition more negligible.",
      "13": "In addition, the impact of foreign presence on markups may vary depending on incumbent firms' ownership structures. To study differential impacts of FDI presence depending on the ownership structure of incumbent firms, we estimate a modified version of (2) with interaction terms with dummies for foreign ownership ( $M N E_{i, s, t}$ ) and state ownership ( $S O E_{i, s, t}$ ). The results from the resulting regressions are summarized in Table 3. The coefficient on the interaction of FDI presence and MNE status tends to be statistically insignificant. In contrast, interactions between a dummy for SOE and foreign presence tend to have positive and at least marginally statistically significant coefficients. This finding suggests that FDI may introduce competition for both foreign- and domestic-owned private firms but that SOEs may be insulated from these competitive pressures through other mechanisms, e.g., preferential financing, subsidies, or regulatory advantages.\n\nTable 3.

      "14": "# Markups of foreign firms vis-à-vis domestic firms \n\nDespite foreign-owned firms increasing competition and decreasing markups at the sector level, we also find evidence that individual foreign-owned firms generally possess higher ability to price above marginal cost relative to their domestic-owned counterparts. Table 4 displays estimates of (3). Across specifications, the coefficient on $M N E_{L, s, t}$ is consistently positive and statistically significant, reflecting how foreign-owned firms are able to charge higher markups than their domestic-owned counterparts. This finding is robust to controls for (lagged) firm productivity, suggesting that the higher markups are driven by higher market power and not just improved efficiency.\n\nIn addition, our results indicate that foreign-owned firms are less able to charge markup premiums in sectors already characterized by high competition from global trade or other foreign firms. In Table 4, the coefficient on the interaction term $M N E_{L, s, t} * E X P_{L, t-1}$ is negative across specifications and statistically significant in our preferred specification with markup estimates assuming a translog production function. A similar pattern exists for $M N E_{L, s, t} * F D I_{L, t-1}$.

Robustness tests \n\n## Exclusion and inclusion of potential outliers\n\nOutlier sectors and years may potentially drive the results for both the impact of foreign presence and foreign control on markups. To account for this possibility, we rerun our preferred specifications from Table 2 (Column 4) and Table 5 (Column 1), excluding two-digit sectors and years one at a time. Our findings are robust to dropping individual sectors and years, with regression coefficients preserving their",
      "16": "signs, statistical significance, and approximate magnitude regardless of which individual sector or year is dropped. ${ }^{9}$\n\nIn addition, it is possible that the inclusion or exclusion of extreme values may be driving our observed results. To account for this possibility, we reintroduce potentially valid markup observations that had been dropped (i.e., those markups greater than three, although markups less than zero remain excluded as they are not plausibly valid) and experiment with different levels of winsorization and then rerun our preferred specifications. Again, the regression coefficients largely preserve their signs, statistical significance, and approximate magnitudes across specifications, as seen in Table 6 and Table 7.\n\nTable 6.

To control for the non-random selection of acquired firms, we apply propensity score matching and reweighting to construct a counterfactual by matching acquired firms with similar firms that were not acquired. By combining propensity score reweighting with the difference-in-differences estimator, we estimate the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), which compares the actual post-acquisition markup of a target firm and the situation had the firm not been acquired (Stiebale \\& Vencappa, 2018).\n\nA probit regression is used to calculate propensity scores for the likelihood of acquisition by a foreign acquirer controlling for industry and year fixed effects. According to the coefficients from the probit estimation reported in Table 8, output is a significant predictor of foreign acquisition regardless of specification. Total factor productivity is also associated with a higher propensity to be acquired when the specification accounts for all available information before the acquisition (Columns 3-4).",

Policy implications and agenda for future research \n\nOverall, evidence from Vietnam suggests that FDI and, by extension, pro-FDI reforms are pro-consumer. Within Vietnam, greater foreign firm presence is associated with lower markups. Thus, further opening sectors to FDI is likely to be beneficial for competition and domestic consumers. Such reforms could be especially important in the current context of industries undergoing consolidation due to pandemic-driven bankruptcies. At the same time, FDI does not decrease markups as much in export-intensive sectors, one area where higher markups are more of a 'good' thing for the host country. These findings hold at the sector level despite individual foreign-owned firms charging higher markups than domestic-owned firms at the firm level, perhaps owing to foreign-owned firms' 'premium-ness' (e.g., via brand names or reputation).\n\nHowever, FDI may need to be accompanied by complementary reforms-particularly with respect to SOEs-for countries to reap the full benefits of increased competition from FDI. We find suggestive evidence that FDI intensity does not decrease the markups of SOEs as much as those of other firms, suggesting that SOEs are insulated from the competitive pressures introduced by FDI. This finding may be driven by SOEs receiving preferential financing, subsidies or other policy-related advantages. Thus, insofar as SOEs operate in areas important to domestic consumers, host-country governments may wish to package FDI reforms with efforts to level the playing field between SOEs and private firms or even privatization. Such SOE reforms could include ensuring neutrality between SOEs and private enterprises with respect to product market regulations, public procurement processes, and taxation (World Bank,",
      "20": "2019) and are likely to be especially important in contexts like Vietnam's, where SOEs continue to play a significant role in the local economy (Dang, Nguyen, \\& Taghizadeh-Hesary, 2020).\n\nFuture research could provide further evidence on the impact of FDI on competition and market power in developing countries as well as analyze heterogeneity. As mentioned earlier, most of the evidence on the relationship between FDI, competition, markups, and market power come from studies of high-income countries. Expanding to further countries beyond Vietnam would thus help to deepen the evidence base for developing countries. In addition, studies across different country settings sometimes draw conflicting conclusions regarding the impact of FDI on markups and market power. Analyzing why the impact of FDI may differ across contexts (e.g., based on policy environment or industry structure) would enrich policymakers' and researchers' understanding of the trade-offs of FDI and how to maximize the benefits of FDI. Further research on whether there are differential impacts based on mode of FDI entry (e.g., mergers and acquisitions versus greenfield) would also allow for more tailored policies for maximizing the development impact of FDI. Finally, if additional data were available, analysis of FDI's impact on competition could be expanded to cover services, especially with respect to digital platforms.",

      "1": "# Abstract \n\nThe estimated duration of forced displacement situations is a key parameter in defining an adequate response to the crisis. Where the crisis is short, humanitarian aid may suffice; when it lasts, development interventions are required. Using data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, this paper proposes propose a new approach to estimate the mean and median durations of exile, and their variations over time. The analysis finds that people who were refugees at the end of 2015 have been in exile for an average duration of 10.3 years and a\nmedian duration of 4 years; the average duration of exile has varied between 10 and 15 years since the late 1990s. The number of people who are in protracted situations (over five years) has been steady at 5 million to 7 million since the mid-1990s, and currently stands at 6.6 million. For those people, the average duration of exile is as long as 21.2 years. All these estimates are very sensitive to two situations: Afghanistan, where the crisis has been ongoing since 1979 and increases all averages, and the Syrian Arab Republic, which is relatively recent and lowers the averages.\n\nThis paper is a product of the Fragility, Conflict and Violence Cross-Cutting Solutions Area and Poverty and Inequality Team, Development Research Group.

      "3": "# Introduction \n\nThe Syrian conflict, the unfolding tragedy across the Mediterranean Sea, and the surge of refugees streaming into Europe have drawn the world's attention to the plight of refugees. Policy makers, from East Africa to South Asia, from the Mashreq to the European Union, are struggling to find an adequate response to a crisis which has deep and potentially significant political, economic, and social consequences. As of end-2015, there were 15.5 million refugees (including asylum seekers and people in refugee-like situations) under the mandate of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). This is the second largest crisis since 1951.\n\nToday, developing countries host the bulk of refugees. Yet, recent events amply demonstrate that in the absence of an adequate international response the crisis cannot be easily contained to a few host countries; some refugees engage in secondary movements and increasingly try to reach OECD countries.\n\nThere have been numerous anecdotal reports of refugees remaining in exile for generations. Indeed, forced displacement can last. This duration is highly variable across situations: the exile of Kosovars in 1999 lasted for several weeks, while it has reached close to 70 years for Palestinians. From an operational perspective, the type of support that is needed in protracted situations is essentially distinct from what is necessary during relatively short crises. With the passing of time temporary lack of schooling turns into illiteracy, pressures on social or urban services gradually weaken systems, and the humanitarian response eventually becomes financially unsustainable. In such situations, a different type of approach is needed, one that relies on economic growth and opportunities and that requires a strong engagement by development actors (World Bank 2016). In short, the very nature of the necessary response to a refugee crisis is determined by the (expected) duration of the crisis.\n\nAssessing the likely duration of exile is hence of crucial importance. It helps shape the political environment in which host countries and potential host countries are making policy decisions. It provides the basis on which effective assistance programs can be designed, including the optimal mix of emergency and medium-term support, the degree to which programs need to be embedded in country systems, and the required policy adjustments in host countries.\n\nBased on existing data, it is not possible to calculate an expectancy of the duration of exile as individual-level data are not available. We can however calculate the average number of years people who are currently refugees have already spent in exile. This number can help determine",
      "4": "the degree to which the global response should include a development element. We find that the average stood at around 10.3 years at the end of 2015, with a median duration of 4 years, and significant sensitivity to a few situations. Such numbers re-emphasize the importance of effective humanitarian interventions on the right scale. They suggest that development actors have a role to play but that they need to focus their interventions on a set of discrete protracted situations.\n\nTo produce these numbers, we rely on the Population Statistics Database compiled and maintained by UNHCR. The database records the number of \"persons of interest\" to UNHCR in each year since 1951 and for each situation, where a situation consists of a pair host-origin countries. The calculation of duration of exile is obtained under a no-turnover assumption, whereby a decrease in the number of refugees for any given situation is fully attributed to exits from refugee status, while increases are assumed to be fully accounted for by new cases. Although such approach tends to over-estimate the true duration of exile, the lack of individual-level data on registration precludes refining the estimate further.\n\nAttempts to estimate similar statistics have been limited. In a 2004 note to its Executive Committee, UNHCR established the average at 17 years at the end of 2003 (Executive Committee of the High Commissioner's Programme 2004). This number has been widely quoted by media, activists, humanitarian agencies, and development institutions (Milner 2014; United Nations 2016; UNHCR 2015).\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 gives some definitions and background information on the refugee population. In section 2, we provide some summary statistics from our main source of data, the UNHCR Population Statistics Database. Section 3 describes the method followed to construct duration statistics and presents a few stylized facts. The results of our analysis are presented in section 4 . Section 5 concludes.\n\n# 1 Background: Definitions and Data \n\nUnder the terms of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees -henceforth the Conventionlater amended by the 1967 Protocol, a refugee is a person, who \"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\"\n\nData on refugees and asylum seekers are collected by individual countries, international orga-",
      "5": "nizations such as UNHCR, and national and international non-governmental organizations. Data is compiled from a number of sources, including but not restricted to individual registration of refugees and asylum seekers (information typically includes name, gender, date of birth, country of origin, marital status, and place of displacement), tracking of population movement in situations where the movement is fluid or continuous, standardized surveys such as Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) surveys, Labor Force Surveys (LFS), Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), administrative records and registries. Yet, data collection is a difficult exercise, due to both methodological issues (UNHCR 2014) and practical challenges, especially in situations of heightened insecurity or mass refugee situations.\n\nTo date, UNHCR maintains the most comprehensive statistical database under a uniform methodology. UNHCR publishes annual data on refugee flows and stocks by countries of residence and origin dating back to 1951, shortly after the Office was established. UNHCR publishes annual statistical reports ranging from \"Global Trends\", \"Mid-year trends\", \"Asylum trends\", to a \"Statistical Yearbook\". There is a consensus that these data provide the most reliable source of information (Sarzin 2016).\n\nOur analysis exclusively uses data from the 1951-2015 UNHCR Population Statistics Reference database (extracted September 18 2015). Data were provided for 173 countries: 77 percent of these data were based on individual refugee registration, 13 percent on estimates, 5 percent on combined estimation and registration, and 5 percent on other sources. The data are structured as follows: for each situation, the database records annual numbers of persons of concern, which comprise \"Refugees (including refugee-like situations)\", \"Asylum seekers\", \"Internally Displaced Persons\", \"Returnees\", \"Stateless\" persons, and \"Others of concern\". A situation is a pair country of origin/country of destination. For example, Somali refugees in Kenya account for one situation, Somali refugees in Ethiopia for another, and South Sudanese refugees in Kenya for yet another. Furthermore, a situation is considered major if it involves more than 25,000 people. It is referred to as protracted if it is major for at least 5 continuous years.\n\nThe database, and therefore our analysis, is limited to refugees under UNHCR protection.\nIt does not include asylum seekers, i.e. individuals who have sought international protection under the 1951 Convention but whose claims for refugee status have not yet been determined, and persons in \"refugee-like situations\", i.e. individuals outside their country or territory of origin who face protection risks similar to those of refugees, but for whom refugee status has, for practical or other reasons, not been ascertained (e.g., undocumented Rohingya originating from Myanmar",
      "6": "in Bangladesh).\nThe data set we use does not cover the 5.1 million Palestinian refugees who are under the mandate of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The definition of Palestinian refugees in international law is distinct from other refugees. Palestinian refugees are people \"whose normal place of residence was Mandatory Palestine between June 1946 and May 1948, who lost both their homes and means of livelihood as a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict\". Importantly, their patrilineal descendants are also considered refugees regardless of citizenship (UNRWA 2009).\n\nFor the purpose of the analysis, we do not include Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), who are defined as \"persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or leave their home or place of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized border\" (United Nations 2004). The categories \"returnees\", \"Stateless\", and \"Others of concern\" are also not included.\n\nOverall, we account for more than 99 percent of the total number of persons of concern for UNHCR who are not either IDPs, Stateless, asylum-seekers, or returnees.\n\n# 2 What do UNHCR data tell us? \n\nFigure 1 plots the total number of refugees worldwide since 1960. The total count stood at 15.5 million at the end of 2015. It has recorded wide variations since 1951, with a substantial increase over the last period. The current crisis is the second largest since UNHCR was established in 1951. The earlier peak, in the first half of the 1990s, was concommitant to the collapse of the Soviet Union, the dislocation of Former Yugoslavia, and the Rwanda genocide.",
      "7": "![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nFigure 1: Total number of refugees (1960-2015)\n\nWhile the ongoing refugee crisis is global, it remains largely concentrated in developing countries especially in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. Table 1 reports the top ten origin and destination countries as of 2015. Beside 5.1 million Palestinian refugees, over half of the refugees worldwide originate from the Syrian Arab Republic, Afghanistan and Somalia, with South Sudan, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Myanmar, the Central African Republic, Iraq, and Eritrea also accounting for large numbers. Not surprisingly, the overwhelming majority of the refugees are hosted in neighboring countries: Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan for Syrian refugees, Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran for Afghan refugees, and Ethiopia and Kenya for Somali refugees. The influx of refugees towards the European Union (and especially Germany and Sweden), while representing less than 10 percent of the total, has demonstrated that the crisis cannot be contained in isolated corners of the world (see Do and Werker [2016] for a descriptive analysis of the so-called European migrant crisis).",

Yet, forced displacement situations are inherently dynamic and there are often significant variations in the number of refugees during a displacement period. This is often the reflection of the circumstances that cause refugee movements. To illustrate the extent to which UNHCR refugee statistics capture such evolving circumstances, Figure 2 displays refugee statistics for three situations: Somalis, Afghans, and Congolese refugees.\n\nPanel 2a shows the number of Somalis who are hosted in Kenya. Refugees started to arrive massively around 1990, after the fall of the Siad Barre regime and the ensuing civil war. Their number declined slightly around the end of the United Nations intervention (1992-1995) as military clashes between factions became shorter, generally less intense, and more localized. It increased again after 2006, when the Islamic Courts Union challenged the Transitional National Government, leading to an Ethiopia-led military intervention. The combination of violence and food crises that plagued Somalia in late 2000s further pushed into exile large numbers of destitute Somalis. The relative stabilization of the situation since 2012 following the establishment of the Federal Government of Somalia has led to a small decrease of the number of refugees.\n\nThe situation of Afghans in Pakistan follows a similar pattern of ebbs and flows as the political and military situation evolved. Panel 2b reflects the large number of Afghans who fled to Pakistan following the 1979 Soviet invasion, and remained in exile until the withdrawal of Soviet troops in",

      "10": "1989. There were massive returns in 1991, which resulted in a sharp reduction of refugee numbers. But the outflow resumed in the late 1990s as the Talibans expanded their power and zone of influence. The US-led invasion in late 2001, and the fall of the Taliban regime, allowed for significant returns, but the renewed deterioration of the situation led to a new outflow after 2007.\n\nFinally, panel 2c captures the exodus of Congolese leaving the Eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to Tanzania as insecurity spread following the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda (and the flight to DRC of many of the \"genocidaires\"). Their number rapidly increased as Laurent-Désiré Kabilas Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL) launched its march towards Kinshasa to unseat President Mobutu. A small decline following the establishment of the new regime in 1997, was soon followed by a new and larger outflow, as Rwanda and Uganda supported a new rebellion which soon engulfed Eastern DRC in extreme violence and chaos. The reunification of the country following the Sun City negotiations in 2002, paved the way for a gradual return of refugees, although some have remained in exile.\n\n# 3 Methodological approach \n\nThe construction of duration statistics with aggregate data is an arduous exercise. For we do not have information on individual exile experience, hence making necessary some assumptions on turnover. It is also important to clarify what can be measured with available data. This is not the average time people remain refugees: such a statistics would have to include situations that are over and make predictions on the future. It is the average time people who are currently refugees have already spent as refugees. Short of individualized data or detailed breakdown of the population by exile durations, it is not possible to estimate the exile expectancy, i.e. the time a refugee can expect to remain in exile.\n\nTo overcome such lack of information in the data we are using, we make the following noturnover assumptions. It is assumed that the same individuals are counted year after year. There is at this stage no data to ensure that people who are counted one year are the same as those who are counted the next year. So person A may well return to her country, while person B arrives: the data will note that one person has been in exile continuously. In most situations, this assumption is not correct (there are back and forth movements between the country of origin and the place of exile), but probably not too far from the reality (as long as conditions in a country are so dire that",
      "11": "people continue to flee in large numbers, massive return is unlikely). It implies, however, that any calculation of a duration is an over-estimate.\n\nTechnically, if a situation has $N_{t}$ registered cases in year $t$, and $N_{t+1}$ in year $t+1$, then the number of individuals who remained in exile between $t$ and $t+1$ is given by $\\min \\left(N_{t} ; N_{t+1}\\right)$. In other words, in years of net refugee outflow, i.e. $N_{t}>N_{t+1}$, the no-turnover assumption implies that there was an exactly $\\left(N_{t}-N_{t+1}\\right)$ outflow of individuals, rather than a larger outflow mitigated by some inflow. Similarly, in years of net refugee inflow, i.e. $N_{t}<N_{t+1}$, it is assumed that no refugee left between $t$ and $t+1$, but rather that $\\left(N_{t+1}-N_{t}\\right)$ is the exact number of newly registered refugees. Such assumption will over-estimate individual exile durations because it ignores the possibility that among the $\\min \\left(N_{t} ; N_{t+1}\\right)$, some might actually be new cases.\n\nWith the no-turnover assumption, we construct a \"lower-bound envelope\" of refugee population dynamics as illustrated in Figure 3. This allows us to determine the earlier possible date of arrival for each cohort of current refugees. As an illustration, we go back to the Somalia-Kenya situation. In 2015, the number of Somali refugees in Kenya amounted to 418,844 persons. The first year such number was reached was in 2011. The no-turnover assumption implies that all current refugees have been in exile for 3 years. But in 2010, the number of refugees was 353,208 persons. We conclude that the difference between 2010 and 2011 represents 74,104 new refugees in 2010, who have hence been in exile for four years. In 2009, the number was at 310,458: the difference between 2009 and 2010 (42,750) are therefore people who have been in exile for five years, etc. We repeat the exercise for each year until the beginning of the crisis in 1991. This gives us a number of new arrivals for each year since 1991. On this basis we can calculate average and median durations for this situation.\n\nNext, we aggregate all situations and consider one single \"global refugee population\". We have for each year a number of people who arrived in a variety of situations and make up a global flow. We can hence calculate global average and median durations. For each year, we can also break down the flow across countries of arrival. We can construct similar lower-bound envelopes starting from any \"current year\" which we choose as a reference point. For example, we can apply the same protocols to evaluate average and median durations as of 1994 (the lower-bound envelope is depicted by the dash-dot line in Figure 3). This allows us to follow the variation of aggregate mean and median averages over time.",

Figure 4 shows the distribution of the \"global refugee flow\" (aggregating all situations) by duration as of 2015. It provides a nuanced picture of the current refugee crisis.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure 4: Distribution of refugees by exile duration (as of 2015)\n\nThere is a large cohort of about 8.9 million \"recent refugees\", who arrived over the last four years. This includes about 4.8 million Syrians, as well as people fleeing from South Sudan (. 7 million), Afghanistan (. 3 million), Ukraine (. 3 million), the Central African Republic (. 3 million), and Pakistan (. 2 million).",
      "13": "Another large cohort, of about 2.2 million, has spent between 5 and 9 years in exile. It includes refugees from Afghanistan ( .5 million), the bulk of the current Somali refugees (. 4 million), and people fleeing from Colombia (. 3 million) and Myanmar (. 2 million).\n\nAbout 2 million people have been in exile between 10 and 34 years. This includes years during which numbers are relatively low, and two episodes where they are higher, around 14 years ago, with the arrival of about .2 million Sudanese refugees, and around 24 and 25 years ago, with the arrival of about .1 million Somalis and .1 million Eritreans.\n\nA last large group of refugees has been in exile for 35 to 37 years: these 2.2 million refugees include mainly Afghans, but also about .3 million ethnic Chinese who fled into China during the 1979 war with Vietnam. Finally, there are few very protracted situations, up to 55 years, including mainly Western Sahara.\n\nMean and median durations The figure also shows that the mean duration current refugees have spent in exile stands at 10.3 years (as of end-2015). The median duration, however, stands at 4 years, i.e. half of the refugees worldwide have spent 4 years or more in exile. These averages however are sensitive to specific situations. For example, if refugees from Afghanistan (and refugees who fled Vietnam to China in 1979) are not included, the mean duration drops to 7.1 years and the median to 3 years.\n\nOur approach also allows us to look at the evolution of the average duration of exile over the years. We restricted our analysis to the post-Cold War era, i.e. from 1991 on, since this marked a fundamental change in the global geopolitical system. Figure 5 displays the evolution over time of the average (panel 5a) and median (panel 5b) durations of exile since 1991. To see how these statistics are affected by particular situations, the dashed line excludes some situations - Afghan refugees, Vietnamese refugees in China, and Syrian refugees.",
      "14": "![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\nFigure 5: Exile duration statistics\n\nIn the absence of any refugee flow (inflow or outflow), the averages should increase by one year for each additional year, i.e. the slope of the line should be equal to 1 . Any downward deviation from that \" 45 -degree line\" can be caused by an outflow of refugees who have been in exile for longer than the average (due to either returns, integration in host countries, or any other reason associated with discontinuation of registration). It may however also be caused by a net inflow of new refugees who would reduce the average duration of exile. Conversely, when the line is steeper than the 45 -degree line, it indicates that outflow mainly consisted of refugees that had not been exiled for long, i.e. less than average.\n\nSince the late 1990s, the mean duration of exile has consistently remained between 10 and 15 years. The relatively low average duration in the 1990s corresponds to a peak flow of refugees leaving their country, as a result of the dislocation of the Soviet Union, of the conflicts in Former Yugoslavia, and of violence in Somalia and the genocide in Rwanda. In this case, a low average duration is the symptom of a deterioration of the global situation. From 1996 on, the mean duration increases along the \" 45 -degree line\", which reflects the relative moderation of in- or outmovements until 1998-1999 and a large return of Rwandans which is paralleled by an outflow of Congolese. The curve once again goes up along a\"45-degree line\" until a peak in 2005. It drops in the following couple of years, largely due to a massive outflow of Iraqi and Somali refugees, renewed violence in Afghanistan, and large-scale departures out of Myanmar. The following years see ups and downs until the Syrian crisis erupts, pushing large amounts of people into exile and hence reducing the average duration of forced displacement. Once again, again a decline in the average duration reflects an aggravation of the problem.",
      "15": "The difference between the solid and dashed lines reflects the importance of three situations: Afghan refugees (see panel 2c) and Vietnamese refugees in China over the entire period, and the Syrian Arab Republic towards the end of the period. In the former case, the total number of refugees has consistently remained above 1 million since 1979. Similarly, the 300,000-strong Vietnamese refugee community who settled in China in 1979 has steadily grown in size ever since, given demographic growth. If these situations are not taken into account in the computation of the average duration of exile, the number henceforth drops by 2 to 4 years. The Syrian crisis shows up in the data in 2012 by bringing the average exile duration down (panel (a)), and its effect on the median is even starker (panel (b)).\n\nThe median however has fluctuated widely, between 4 and 14 years, following the ebbs and flows of ongoing conflicts. It typically increases in years where the flow of new refugees is relatively limited, and it drops dramatically when there are large numbers of new refugees, for example in 1993-1994 (with conflicts in Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda), in 1997-1999 (with conflicts in DRC and other parts of Africa), after 2003 (with conflict in Iraq, Somalia, and Sudan), and since 2013 (with the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic). A decline in the median duration of exile is typically the consequence of a degradation of the global situation.\n\nPeople in protracted situations A natural additional stylized fact that the data can produce is a time series of the number of people in protracted situations. Figure 6 shows the number of refugees who have been exiled for more than 5, 10, 20, and 30 years, respectively. Among current refugees, up to 6.6 million, i.e. about 42.3 percent of the total, have been out of their country for five years or more (i.e. in a protracted situation). The number of protracted refugees has been remarkably stable since 1991, at 5 to 7 million throughout most of the period. A rapid increase around 2007-2008 corresponds to the earlier flow of Sudanese and Iraqi refugees five years earlier. We also find that while the number of refugees in exile for 5 or 10 years has remained relatively stable over time, the number of refugees in exile for over 20 and over 30 years has gradually increased, in large part due to the lack of solution for Afghan refugees.",
      "16": "![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nFigure 6: Number of refugees in protracted situations (1991-2015)\n\nFinally, we look at the evolution of the average and median duration of exile in protracted situations (i.e. only for refugees who have spent at least five year in exile). Figure 7 suggests that until recently, these two numbers have been on an upward trend, driven by long-lasting situations involving large numbers of people. This includes Afghan refugees in Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran, Vietnamese refugees in China, Western Sahara refugees in Algeria and Mauritania, Somalis in Kenya, and Myanmarese in Thailand. The average and median durations for these populations currently stand at 21.2 and 19 years, respectively. The slope of the curve, however, is less than one, which reflects the constant inflow of new forcibly displaced refugees: this is consistent with the trends described above. The decline in the average duration of protracted situations in 2009 corresponds to the peak of entries in these categories that is observed in figure 6.\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nFigure 7: Exile duration statistics - protracted situations",
      "17": "# 5 Conclusion \n\nThis short analysis of UNHCR data provides several insights. First, it shows that available refugee data can be used to clarify some important parts of the policy debate. Much of this debate has been informed by advocacy on the one side, and xenophobia on the other. Using evidence can help provide a more nuanced perspective of a complex issue.\n\nSecond, it highlights the limitations of available data. In particular in the absence of individualized data, it is not possible to calculate the average duration of exile, but only an over-estimate. It is also not possible to calculate an expectancy which could be useful for policy makers. Should individualized data be available, such calculations would become possible.\n\nThird, it provides an over-estimate of the mean duration of exile at around 11 years and of the median duration at about 4 years. The mean duration of exile has been fairly stable since the late 1990s, at 11 to 15 years.\n\nFourth, it underlines the plight of those who are in protracted exile. Their number has remained steady since the mid-1990s, at 5 million to 7 million people. The mean duration of their plight, however, has gradually increased and exceeds 20 years.\n\nFifth, it suggests that all these numbers are very sensitive to two country contexts: Afghanistan, which pushes all averages up (and without which the average duration of protracted situations is reduced by almost half) and the Syrian Arab Republic which still brings them down. Yet, when both situations are excluded, neither the mean nor the median varies substantially.\n\nAnd sixth, it shows that in many cases a reduction in the average duration of exile is the result of an inflow of new refugees, and hence of an aggravation of the situation.\n\nUnfortunately, comparable data are not available to carry out similar calculations for IDPs. The definition of a \"protracted situation\" for IDPs is also complex, considering that there is no clear definition of what would constitute a measurable end-point for their ordeal. Case studies may provide more useful insights than aggregate global figures.\n\nThese numbers re-emphasize the importance of effective humanitarian interventions on the right scale. They suggest that development actors have a role to play but that they need to focus their interventions on a set of discrete situations. Time-series also show that the perceptions of a crisis spinning out of control are not supported by the available evidence. And let us never forget that this is not about numbers but about people and about an immense amount of human suffering.",

Based on data from the Living Standards Measurement Study in the provinces of Hebei and Liaoning, we study the distribution of non-farm income in rural China. First, we assume non-farm income as an exogenous transfer to total income to decompose the Gini index; second, we assume non-farm income as a potential substitute for farm income to take household choices into account and simulate household income. The results show that non-farm activity reduces rural income inequality by raising the income of poor households to a larger extent than that of rich households. Improving rural infrastructure and implementing universal basic education are critical to build up the capacity of households (in particular poor households) to participate in non-farm activity. Strengthening the linkages between farm activity and non-farm activity is essential to optimize the contribution of non-farm activity to pro-poor rural economic development.\n\n\nJEL Classification: D63, O15, Q12\nKey words: Non-farm income, Inequality, China\n\nWorld Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3811, January 2006\nThe Policy Research Working Paper Series disseminates the findings of work in progress to encourage the exchange of ideas about development issues.

It can be considered as an important way to increase overall rural economic activity and employment - in many developing countries, nonfarm activity often accounts for as much as $50 \\%$ of rural employment and a similar percentage share of household income (Lanjouw, 1999a). Average non-farm income share of the total is about $42 \\%$ in Africa, $40 \\%$ in Latin America, and 32\\% in Asia (The World Bank, 2000). Earnings from non-farm activity can not only significantly increase total household income, but also function as a safety net through diversifying income sources. Participating in non-farm activity enhances households' capability of overcoming negative shocks and investing in farm activity. It mitigates income fluctuation and enables the adoption of more profitable but \"risky\" agricultural technologies, which encourage the transformation of traditional agriculture to modern agriculture. ${ }^{1}$ Non-farm income may also prevent rapid or excessive urbanization as well as natural resource degradation through overexploitation. The non-farm sector can hence function as a route out of poverty through reducing the pressure on the demand for land in rural areas, and through breaking the vicious circle of \"poverty - extensive cultivation - ecological deterioration poverty\".\n\nThere has been a debate on the role of non-farm income in rural inequality. Some studies show that although non-farm income increases total rural income, it worsens income inequality because it is more unequally distributed than farm income. ${ }^{2}$ However, some other studies suggest\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    * An earlier version of this paper was prepared for the Conference on Poverty and Income Inequality in Beijing, China (April 2005), organized by the World Institute for Development Economics Research of the United Nations University.

The objective of this paper is to examine whether and why non-farm activity reduces overall household income inequality in rural areas of two Chinese provinces, Hebei and Liaoning, in 1995/1997.4\n\nThe oversupply of agriculture labor, the relatively limited quantity of arable land, and the obsolete agricultural technology in China result in its low level of farm income per capita. The economic reforms, in particular the implementation of the Household Responsibility System (HRS), in the late 1970s, not only stimulated the incentive of the farmers and contributed to the increase of the agricultural productivities, but also legitimized the rural redundant labor to leave land and participate in non-farm activity. Since then, the non-farm sector has played an increasingly important role in absorbing the surplus agricultural labor and reducing rural poverty. ${ }^{5}$ Based on the data from the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS), we study rural household income determination. We examine the impacts of participation in non-farm activity on rural income inequality in two ways: First, we assume non-farm income as an exogenous transfer to total income to decompose the Gini index; second, we assume non-farm income as a potential substitute for farm income to take household choices into account and simulate household income. The results suggest that non-farm activity reduces rural inequality. The poor households would have suffered a relatively larger income loss than the rich households if they were not allowed to participate in non-farm activity.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: section 2 briefly reviews the development of non-farm activity in rural China; section 3 describes the income composition and characteristics of households in the provinces of Hebei and Liaoning, based on the LSMS data; section 4 discusses two analytical methods, namely, the decomposition of the Gini index and the simulation of household income; section 5 studies the determination of non-farm activity participation and the distribution of the household income with and without non-farm activity; and section 6 presents the conclusions.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ See the results obtained by Adams (1994); Chinn (1979); de Janvry and Sadoulet (2001); Lachaud (1999); Stark et al.

      "3": "# 2 Economic reforms in China and the development of non-farm activity \n\nThe labor market in China was fragmented with a significant rural-urban divide. Following the model of the former-USSR, the government of China heavily taxed agriculture to support the development of heavy industries in the planned-economy era. Before the economic reforms in 1978, although labor productivity in rural areas was very low, farmers were not allowed to leave the land. The rural collectivization and the civil registration system were the two major barriers that made rural-urban migration impossible or impractical. ${ }^{6}$ The income of a farmer was mainly determined by the time he or she spent on the collective land (rural collectivization, gongfenzhi). ${ }^{7}$ Under the civil registration system, one with rural hukou was not eligible for most of the social services in urban areas, such as health care services and education for children.\n\nThe economic reforms in the late 1970s brought big changes in China. First, the collapse of the system of \"People's Commune\" and the implementation of the HRS in rural areas restored greater liberty to farmers in choosing their careers and their modes of production. ${ }^{8}$ To some extent, rural households can allocate their labor to maximize their expected returns between farm activity, local rural non-farm activity, migration, etc. Second, agricultural reforms greatly increased the supply of grains, which gradually led to the abolishment of the rationing system. Food became available in free markets in urban areas in the 1980s. Housing, health services, and education for children became more accessible for rural-to-urban migrants without urban civil status (hukou) in the 1990s. Third, the development of the non state-owned economies generated large demand for informal workers. Most of the job openings in informal sectors were low-paid and unattractive to urban citizens, which offered opportunities for rural migrants. ${ }^{9}$ All these factors induced a vast movement of agricultural labor from rural areas to cities.\n\nAlthough the fragmentation of the rural-urban labor market has been much improved after the economic reforms, the misallocation of labor resources still leads to a significant economic welfare loss. A recent study by the World Bank estimates large potential gains from greater labor market integration - using 2001 as a baseline, with a mere $1 \\%$ labor relocation from rural areas to urban areas, the overall economy will gain by $0.5 \\%$. If the share of labor outflow reaches $5 \\%$ and 10\\%, GDP will grow by $2.5 \\%$ and $5 \\%$, respectively (The World Bank, 2005).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ See Davin (1999); Zhu (2002).\n    ${ }^{7}$ See McMillan et al. (1989).\n    ${ }^{8}$ See de Beer and Rocca (1997); Zhu and Jiang (1993).\n    ${ }^{9}$ Because of the wide gap in earning opportunities between rural and urban areas, such low-paid jobs were still attractive to rural migrants.",
      "4": "The oversupply of labor keeps agricultural productivity low in China. Rural to urban migration is one of the major solutions for reducing the income gap between the urban formal industrial sectors and the rural traditional agricultural sectors (Lewis, 1954). However, in the case of China, the urban sectors are not capable of absorbing the large quantity of redundant labor in rural areas. Although the shortage of food is no longer a threat, the government continues nevertheless to control rural-to-urban migration through some direct or indirect measures for two principal reasons. First, the urban infrastructure is not sufficient to offer enough public services to rural migrants without lowering those to the urban citizens. The urban residents are not willing to share their relatively higher living standards with the rural residents. Second, the urban areas also have the problems of unemployment, in particular due to the state-owned-enterprises (SOEs) reforms. The urban sectors cannot offer enough additional job opportunities for rural migrants. The development of the service sector is going to be important for developing the \"pull forces\" to the cities. In China, the \"push forces\" from the countryside are strong, but the \"pull forces\" in cities remain insufficient. Excessive rapid rural-to-urban migration may lead to serious socialeconomic problems. In this context, the rural non-farm sector, consisting mainly of township and village enterprises (TVEs) and the rural private economies, becomes irreplaceably important for economic development in China. ${ }^{10}$ Since 1978, the rural total household income per capita increased rapidly, but the income earned from the primary sector decreased relative to that earned from secondary and tertiary sectors. In early 2002, non-farm income represented about half of total rural household income (National Statistics Bureau of China, 2003).\n\nSome studies show that rural inequality in China has significantly increased since the beginning of the economic reforms, and suggest that such an increase in inequality can essentially be explained by the growing importance of non-farm income in total income. Knight and Song (1993) and Hussain et al. (1994) argue that the distribution of non-farm income is more unequal than that of farm income in China. Bhalla (1990), Burgess (1998), Ravaillon and Chen (1999), Wagstaff (2005), Yao (1999), Zhu (1991) and Zhou (1994) suggest that the sharp increase in inequality in rural household income is mainly attributed to the difference in skills, knowledge, and capital endowments.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ See also Aubert (1995); Banister and Taylor (1990); Byrd and Lin (1994); Goldstein and Goldstein (1991); Zhou (1994).",
      "5": "Based on the LSMS data of the provinces of Hebei and Liaoning, our analysis suggests that the poor households gain more from non-farm activity than the rich households. One of the important reasons is that households that suffer stronger constraints in farm activity are more likely to participate in non-farm activity, and earn relatively higher income compared to those with better resources. Whether a household participates in non-farm activity depends on its incentive and capability. Households are motivated to undertake rural non-farm activity by either \"pull\" or \"push\" factors. If the non-farm sector has high returns, the \"pull factors\" will be strong; if farm activity cannot provide enough income for households (for example, if farm output is inadequate due to drought, flood, or insufficiency of land) or households need to diversify their income sources, the \"push factors\" may kick in. Poor households are less capable of weathering negative shocks, and are more risk averse. In order to have additional income as well as to diversify and undertake activities with returns that may have a low or negative correlation with those of farming, poor households may have stronger incentives to participate in non-farm activity; while rich households may have better capacity to do so thanks to their better endowments in physical and human capital (FAO, 1998). In rural China, the credit and insurance markets are underdeveloped. Households have strong incentives to diversify their income sources. However, because of their limited capacity and liquidity constraints, poor households tend to participate in non-farm activity with a high labor to capital ratio and low entry barriers.\n\nThe high participation in non-farm activity among low-income rural households may result in a more equal distribution of total income. For example, Adams and He (1995) and Adams (1999) argue that non-farm income reduces overall inequality in Pakistan and in Egypt, respectively. They suggest that households with low farm income (because of unequal access to land, etc.) are more likely to engage in non-farm activity, and the pro-poor distribution of nonfarm income across the income scale of the population mitigates inequality.\n\nIn the following sections, we will examine the determinants of participation in non-farm activity and those of non-farm income, and study the impacts of non-farm income on rural inequality in the case of two Chinese provinces, Hebei and Liaoning.",
      "6": "# 3 Data descriptions \n\nIn this paper, we use the data from China's LSMS, which was conducted in July 1995 and July 1997 in two provinces: Hebei and Liaoning. ${ }^{11}$ The survey includes information from 787 rural households, which were selected from a total of 31 sample villages of 15 towns or townships in 6 counties. Although the sample size is limited, the LSMS employs standardized sampling techniques on household selection and offers a satisfactory sample for in-depth studies. ${ }^{12}$ The sample can be considered a rough approximation of the rural population in Hebei and Liaoning. ${ }^{13}$ Compared with other survey data, which can merely serve for descriptive analysis, the LSMS data have significant advantages. To our knowledge, the LSMS is the most detailed and professional survey of rural households in China in recent years.\n\nRural household income consists of two major parts: farm income and non-farm income. The farm sector includes agriculture, livestock, forestry, fishing, and hunting. The non farm \"sector\" includes all economic activities in rural areas except the above farm activities. ${ }^{14}$ Formal or informal wage-paying income and self-employment income are the two major sources of nonfarm income. ${ }^{15}$ Among the 787 households in the sample, 205 received only farm income, 537 both farm income and non-farm income, 38 only non-farm income, and 7 neither farm income nor non-farm income. ${ }^{16}$ To focus the study on farm income and non-farm income, we exclude the households that do not have farm income (which represents about 5\\% of the total sample), and take \"the income from other sources\" out of total income of the household in the econometric analysis by considering this income as exogenous. ${ }^{17}$ Table 1 describes the sample characteristics of the remaining 742 households.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ In 1996, the GDP per capita of these Liaoning and Hebei ranked $8^{\\text {th }}$ and $12^{\\text {th }}$ respectively among the 30 provinces in China.\n    ${ }^{12}$ The LSMS is designed to provide a comprehensive picture of household welfare and the factors that affect it. In order to minimize non-sampling error and ensure high quality data, the samples of the LSMS are relatively small. Substantial efforts and resources, including long interviewer trainings, use of direct informants, concurrent data entry with in-field corrections taking place at the households, and low supervisor-interviewer ratios, are devoted to enhance data quality.

      "8": "number of workers is 2.44 per household. ${ }^{19}$ The average number of years of education is 5.89 , which is equal to the level of the primary school completion. The average land surface per household is $10.48 \\mathrm{mus},{ }^{20}$ and the per capita level is only 2.92 mus. In other words, land is a scarce resource in rural China, only 0.19 hectares per capita. Compared to the households that participate only in farm activity, the households that participate in non-farm activity have a larger number of workers, a higher education level, a lower level land surface, and live closer to urban centers / hubs of transport.\n\n# 4 Methodologies \n\nBased on the LSMS data, we use two methods to study the impacts of non-farm income on rural inequality. First, we consider non-farm income as an \"exogenous transfer\", which adds to pre-existing total household income, to decompose total household income and study the distribution of each income source and its contribution to total income inequality. Second, we consider non-farm income as a \"potential substitute\" for farm income, and compare the level and distribution of observed total household income with those without non-farm income.\n\n### 4.1 Method I: Decomposition of the Gini index\n\nThe method of the decomposition of the Gini index is often used to analyze income inequality (Pyatt et al., 1980; Stark, 1991). Suppose that $y_{1}, y_{2}, \\cdots, y_{K}$ stand for the $K$ components of household income and $y_{0}$ the total income, $y_{0}=\\sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{k}$. The Gini index of the total income, $G_{0}$, can be decomposed as follows:\n\n$$\nG_{0}=\\sum_{k=1}^{K} R_{k} G_{k} S_{k}\n$$\n\nwhere $S_{k}$ stands for the share of the component $k$ in the total income, $G_{k}$ the Gini index corresponding to the component $k$; and $R_{k}$ the correlation between the Gini indices of the component $k$ and the total income. Hence, the Gini index $G_{0}$ is decomposed into three components: (i) the share of the component $k$ in total income, $S_{k}$; (ii) the inequality of the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{19}$ Here \"workers\" are the household members who are at least 15 years old and can participate in productive activity. ${ }^{20} 1 \\mathrm{mu}=1 / 15$ hectares.",
      "9": "distribution of the said component, $G_{k}$; and (iii) the correlation between the component $k$ and the total income, $R_{k}$.\n\nTo study the impacts of non-farm income on inequality, we compare the Gini index of total income (which includes non-farm income), $G_{0}$, with that of farm income only, $G_{a}$. If the value of $G_{0}$ is inferior to that of $G_{a}$, non-farm income reduces total income inequality; and vice-versa.\n\nThis method provides a direct and simple measure of how non-farm income contributes to total income. However, non-farm income is treated independently of farm income and considered more as an income transfer. In other words, for a given household, with a given level of farm income, an increase in non-farm income raises total income by the same amount. This could be true if the non-farm activity participation was to compensate a short-term shock, such as a bad harvest or drought/flood. But, more often than not, participation in non-farm activity is a longterm alternative choice of participation in farm activity for the households in our case. The nonfarm workers would contribute to their families in alternative ways if they had not participated in non-farm activity. This method, the decomposition of the Gini index, does not address the interdependence of farm and non-farm activity participation. If there is substitutability between participation in farm activity and non-farm activity, the decomposition is biased (Escobal, 2001; Kimhi, 1994). In the following sub-section, we will relax the assumption of independence of farm activity and non-farm activity, and simulate total household income.\n\n# 4.2 Method II: Simulation of household income \n\nIn order to compare the distribution of the observed household income with that of the simulated income without non-farm activity, it is important to take the interactions between the participation in non-farm activity and that in farm activity into account. Households that participate in non-farm activity may be systematically different from those that only participate in farm activity. Adams (1989) estimates a function of household income determination for nonmigrant households, and applies the coefficients and the endowment bundles of migrant households (in the absence of migration and remittances) to impute their earnings under a nonmigration scenario and study the impacts of remittances on inequality. Barham and Boucher (1998) correct the selection bias and improve the income simulation model. Using a bi-variate probit model of double selection, Lachaud (1999) moves a step forward to simulate the household",

To take into account the interdependence of the participation in farm activity and non-farm activity, we will examine the impacts of non-farm income on inequality in three steps: first, we estimate the household income equations based on the observed values; second, we simulate the household income if the households only participate in farm activity; and third, we compare the Gini index of the simulated income with that of the observed income (the total income including non-farm income).\n\n# 4.2.1 Estimation of income equations \n\nThe expected income of a particular activity is determined by the probability of participating in this activity and the net expected income received by the household subject to participation in this activity (Taylor \\& Yunez-Naude, 1999). Using the probit model, first, we estimate the participation equation in which a dummy variable, which is equal to 1 if the household participates in the activity and 0 otherwise, is regressed on the independent variables:\n\n$$\nP_{i}^{*}=\\alpha Z_{i}+\\varepsilon_{i} \\quad P_{i}=1 \\Leftrightarrow P_{i}^{*}>0 ; P_{i}=0 \\Leftrightarrow P_{i}^{*} \\leq 0\n$$\n\nwhere $P_{i}^{*}$ is a non-observed continuous latent variable and $P_{i}$ is an observed binary variable, with a value of 1 if the household participates in the non-farm activity and 0 if it does not; $Z_{i}$ is a vector of independent variables of the participation equation.\n\nSecond, we use the method of Heckman (1979) to correct the selection bias, and estimate the income equation for the households that participate only in farm activity. We introduce the inverse Mills ratio obtained from equation (2) to equation (3):\n\n$$\n\\log y_{i}=\\beta X_{i}+\\gamma \\lambda_{i}+\\mu_{i} \\quad \\text { for } P_{i}=0\n$$\n\nwhere $y_{i}$ is the total household income; $X_{i}$ a vector of independent variables; and $\\lambda_{i}$ inverse Mills ratios. ${ }^{21}$ We consider equation (3) as the income equation in the case where a household participates only in farm activity.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{21}$ For the households that participate only in farm activity, $\\lambda_{i}=-\\phi\\left(\\hat{\\alpha} Z_{i}\\right) /\\left(1-\\Phi\\left(\\hat{\\alpha} Z_{i}\\right)\\right)$; for the households that participate in non-farm activity, $\\lambda_{i}=\\phi\\left(\\hat{\\alpha} Z_{i}\\right) / \\Phi\\left(\\hat{\\alpha} Z_{i}\\right)$.",

However, for two reasons, the distribution of this estimated income cannot be considered as that of the income in the absence of non-farm activity. First, in general, the variation of the estimated value is less volatile than that of the observed value. The value of the Gini index of the distribution of $\\hat{y}_{i}^{f}$ is much lower than that of $y_{i}$ (observed income). Second, the unobserved terms, i.e. the residual, may also play an important role in the income distribution. It's necessary to generate a full distribution of income for the households that participate in non-farm activity. The method is as follows.\n\nFor the households that participate only in farm activity $\\left(P_{i}=0\\right)$, we simply take the observed value:\n\n$$\n\\log y_{i}=\\log \\hat{y}_{i}^{f}+\\mu_{i} \\quad \\text { for } P_{i}=0\n$$\n\nwhere $y_{i}$ and $\\hat{y}_{i}^{f}$ stand respectively for observed income and simulated income; $\\mu_{i}$ the residual. For the households that participate in non-farm activity, we simulate the residual (the unobservable part) to generate the full income distribution. Using equation (5), we calculate the variance of $\\mu_{i}$, noted as $\\sigma^{2}$, for the households that participate only in farm activity $\\left(P_{i}=0\\right)$. Suppose that (i) $\\sigma^{2}$ is constant, ${ }^{22}$ (ii) the variance of $\\mu_{i}$ for the households that participate only in farm activity and for those that also participate in other activity are identical.

      "13": "# 5.1 Non-farm income as an exogenous transfer \n\nUnder the hypothesis that non-farm income is an exogenous transfer, the Gini index can be decomposed into three parts: the share of each income component, the Gini index of each income component, and the Gini correlation of each income component. The first column of table 2 shows that the farm income is the largest component of the total income (58.6\\%), following by the non-farm income (31.5\\%). The second column shows that the Gini index of the distribution of the observed total income, including the contribution of non-farm activity, is 0.508 ; while that of the distribution of the farm income is 0.579 . It suggests that, in the absence of non-farm activity, household income would have been $14.0 \\%$ more unequal. In other words, the presence of nonfarm income reduces rural income inequality.\n\nTable 2 Decomposition of Gini Index\n\n|  | Percentage of total income | Gini Index |  | Contribution to inequality |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | $S_{k}$ | $G_{k}$ | $R_{k}$ | $\\frac{S_{k} G_{k} R_{k}}{G_{0}}$ |\n| Total income | 100.0 | 0.508 | 1.00 | 100.0 |\n| Farm income | 58.6 | 0.579 | 0.78 | 52.3 |\n| Agriculture | 31.5 | 0.635 | 0.62 | 24.6 |\n| Livestock | 16.0 | 0.729 | 0.45 | 10.3 |\n| Forestry and fishing | 11.1 | 0.986 | 0.81 | 17.4 |\n| Non-farm income | 31.9 | 0.828 | 0.79 | 40.8 |\n| Self-employment | 27.1 | 0.927 | 0.82 | 40.7 |\n| Wage-paying | 4.9 | 0.767 | 0.03 | 0.2 |\n| Other income | 9.5 | 0.781 | 0.47 | 6.9 |\n| Private transfer | 3.1 | 0.895 | 0.16 | 0.9 |\n| Others | 6.4 | 0.849 | 0.56 | 6.0 |\n\nThe LSMS data also show that the distribution of farm income is more equal than that of non-farm income. $94.3 \\%$ of the households participate in farm activity, while only $68.2 \\%$ participate in non-farm activity. $49 \\%$ of the households have income from wage-paying activity, and $39 \\%$ of households have income from self-employment activity.

However, the distribution of the wage-paying income is more egalitarian, with a Gini index of $0.767 .{ }^{23}$\n\n# 5.2 Non-farm income as a potential substitute \n\nWe relax the strong hypothesis on the independence of the participation in non-farm activity and farm activity, and consider non-farm income as a potential substitute for farm income. Among the two major types of non-farm activity, the participation in wage-paying activity is often conditioned by the spatial mobility, for the members concerned may leave their household and work outside; while the self-employment activity is more likely to be local family work. In general, the participation in wage-paying activity is an individual decision, while the participation in self-employment activity can be a choice of the entire household.\n\nThe results of table 3 suggest that the households with more workers are more likely to participate in non-farm activity. Because of the shortage of the cultivable land, the labor productivity in agricultural activity is low. Other things being equal, a larger household will have a lower opportunity cost of having some members working outside. After the implementation of the HRS, surplus rural labor began seeking for job opportunities and leaving farms. However, the number of workers does not influence the participation in self-employment activity. One of the likely reasons is that, self-employment activity requires more starting funds and entrepreneurship. Only some of the rural households with surplus labor are capable and willing to run their own business. ${ }^{24}$ If the households (in particular the rural households) have better endowment in human and physical capital, and/or suffer less liquidity constraints from the underdevelopment of the insurance and credit market, they will be more capable to participate in self-employment activity, other things being equal.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{23}$ The value of the Gini index is sensitive to the number of households that do not have the type of income in question. Because more than $50 \\%$ of the households do not have self-employment (or wage-paying) income, the value of the Gini index of its distribution is relatively high.\n    ${ }^{24}$ The participation of the self-employment activity also depends on the number of the dependent persons, who can partially participate in some non-farm work of the household, such as working in boutiques, restaurants, hotels, food processing, etc.",

However, only a higher education level ( 8 years or above in school) has significant effects on the participation in wage-paying activity. It suggests that the entry barriers, in terms of education, are higher for wage-paying activity. One important reason is that, it is easier for the better educated rural labor to find a non-farm job, other things being equal. The other two variables \"percentage of members that have received some technical or professional training\" ${ }^{26}$ and \"percentage of household members that have been apprentices\", which also measures the quality of labor force, plays a positive role in non-farm activity participation as well. Special trainings can improve the competence of the household members and facilitate their participation in non-farm work, which often requires some knowledge of technology and management. The higher is the percentage of the household members that have some technical and professional training, the higher is the participation rate in self-employment activity. The higher is the percentage of household members that have been apprentices, the higher is the participation rate in non-farm activity. In short, households with more human capital (including formal and informal education) engage more in non-farm activity.\n\nThe number of dependent persons plays a positive role in the participation in selfemployment activity and a negative role in wage-paying activity. ${ }^{27}$ One of the likely reasons may be that the dependent persons can help with the local family activity; but they demand for some routine care, which prevents the other members leaving home for wage-paying activity (Zhao, 1999).\n\nThe coefficient of the variable \"land surface of the household\" is negative and that of the quadratic term is positive with marginal significance for non-farm activity participation. ${ }^{28}$ The shortage of land, the major physical capital of a household, is one of essential motivations of the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{25}$ See also Lanjouw (1999b).\n    ${ }^{26}$ In our case, these technical and professional trainings include: agricultural extension training (13.5\\%), medical specialist (6.2\\%), teacher (4.66\\%), driver (24.9\\%), cook (2.1\\%), tailor (10.9\\%), veterinarian ( $0.5 \\%$ ) and others (37.3\\%).

In general, the site of the township government is the nearest fair for farm households. The railway station often situates in the hubs of transport/communication, or in urban centers. The distance to railway stations can reflect the cost of a long-distance migration. The results suggest that, households live in villages far from markets and/or hubs of transports are less likely to participate in non-farm activity. The long distance from the market not only increases the transport/commute costs of non-farm activity participation, but also lowers the profitability for the local non-farm business. In particular, if we consider that railway stations often locate in cities where there are more wage-paying job opportunities, the significant negative impacts of the distance between the village center and the nearest railway station on the wage-paying activity participation suggests that the geographic remoteness of a village (which is often aggravated by the insufficiency of the transport infrastructures) is one major barrier for the surplus rural labor to participate in wage-paying activity elsewhere. If we consider that bus stations often locate in local fairs / markets where there are better opportunities for small business, the significant negative impacts of the distance between the village center and the nearest bus station on self-employment activity participation suggests that the segmentation from markets lowers the potential for households to participate in self-employment activity. ${ }^{29}$ Improving rural infrastructures and reducing transaction costs are therefore critical for the development of rural non-farm activity.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{29}$ The survey data suggests that households living near bus stations are more likely to participate in self-employment activities, such as running stores or restaurants.",

But these households with higher total income may not be the households that have high farm income. In fact, the participation in non-farm activity is a long-term rational choice of the rural households. The households that choose to participate only in farm activity are usually those with comparative advantages in farming and with a higher expected farm income. If the access to the non-farm sources of income is absent, the poor households, usually those with low level of land resource per capita, are more likely to suffer from the binding constraint and face the cornered solution, because their opportunity costs of labor are lower and their ability to weather negative shocks are weaker, other things being equal. In addition, if those currently employed in the nonfarm sector were engaged in some alternative employment, such as being agricultural labor, agricultural wage rates might be lower and overall income inequality might rise. So rather than raising inequality, in this case, the non-farm sector actually prevents inequality from rising even further. ${ }^{33}$\n\nIn conclusion, the results show that, the non-farm activity participation reduces rural income inequality in China by widening the occupation choice that disproportionately favors the poor households.\n\n# 6 Conclusions \n\nIn rural China, non-farm activity has grown rapidly since the economic reforms in the late 1970s. Although farm income is still a principal income source of rural households, non-farm income also plays a significant role. In the provinces of Hebei and Liaoning in 1995/1997, twothirds of the rural households had non-farm income, and non-farm income represented almost a third of the total household income. The average income of the households that have participated in non-farm activity is higher than that of the households that participate only in farm activity.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{33}$ See also Barrett et al. (2001); Chapman and Tripp (2004).",
      "21": "Our results show that participation in farm activity and non-farm activity is interdependent. With strict liquidity constraints due to the shortage of land, poor households have strong incentives to diversify their income sources and to increase total income. Non-farm activity widens the occupation choice of the rural households, which is disproportionately in favor of the poor. Although the distribution of non-farm income is more unequal than that of farm income, with a higher participation rate of poor households, non-farm activity reduces rural inequality. As an alternative income source, non-farm income can be used to invest in farm activity and in human capital, which can further equalize rural income in the long run.\n\nThe non-farm sector can be a path out of poverty and inequality in rural china. It can absorb surplus agricultural labor and reduce the pressure on the demand for land, without creating excessive burdens for urban infrastructure. To enhance the participation and profitability of nonfarm activity, it is important to improve rural infrastructure, reduce market segmentation, and enlarge the potential of the rural areas; to ensure the pro-poor development of the non-farm sectors, it is critical to increase the capability of the poor households by improving universal basic education and by developing the credit and insurance market in rural areas; and to maximize the impacts of non-farm activity in rural inequality reduction, it is essential to strengthen the linkages between the farm and non-farm sectors, facilitate resource allocation, and enhance overall productivity.\n\n# References \n\nAdams, R.

      "3": "# 1. Introduction \n\nThe COVID-19 crisis represented an unprecedented shock for the private sector, affecting businesses through many channels at an uncontrolled speed and spanning a duration of more than two years. In the process, it unveiled the underlying vulnerabilities of firms, sectors, and countries. These types of crises pose pressing questions not only about the magnitudes and responses to economic shocks in general, but also about the heterogeneity of their effects. For instance, evidence from the COVID-19 shock and recovery indicates that small firms were disproportionately affected (Apedo-Amah et al., 2020; Cirera et al., 2021). Given that most informal firms tend to be small, it is crucial to understand not only the effects of a shock on informal firms, but also if those effects are explained by external characteristics such as firm size or by other internal attributes of informality.\n\nA priori, given the characteristics of informal firms, the magnitude and direction of the impact of crises and, in particular, of the COVID-19 shock are not entirely clear. On the one hand, initially, informal firms are expected to exhibit a worse performance due to their higher vulnerability, including the lack of access to finance from formal sources and the difficulty of public support reaching these firms. Specific to the COVID-19 crisis, these firms are concentrated in sectors requiring more face-to-face interactions and were, therefore, more exposed to the lockdown restrictions. On the other hand, informal firms can avoid certain taxes and regulatory burden and have more flexibility in terms of employment (including lower hiring and firing costs), location, resource management, and market competition (Loayza, 2018). Therefore, informal firms and jobs can more easily recover given their lower organization capital and entry costs (Alfaro et al., 2020).\n\nUsing several rounds of Business Pulse Survey (BPS) data of the World Bank for six countries in South Asia, this paper quantifies the heterogeneity in the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and the recovery of firms by their informality level. Our results suggest that:\n\nFirst, there is a huge overlap in the productivity distribution across formal and informal firms, suggesting that the reasons for staying informal at the lower end of the distribution might be very different than at the higher end. This also points to the possibility that the shock may not affect all informal firms uniformly.\n\nSecond, in line with the existing literature, our BPS data confirms that compared with formal firms, informal firms are smaller, younger, and in sectors with low entry costs. They have lower productivity, with consistently lower levels of management and technological capabilities. Even the better-managed informal firms do not seem to grow in size, especially",
      "4": "the parasitic ones and thereby perpetuate the misallocation of resources.\nThird, the severity of the impact of the COVID-19 shock and the recovery speed are associated with the degree of informality. Moreover, firms' external attributes such as size, sector, age, and gender of the owner do not explain the depth of the impact. Characteristics of informal firms that are intrinsic, such as poor management capabilities and education of the manager and owners are strong predictors of poor outcomes among informal firms.\n\nFourth, results, including split regressions, fully interacted models, Shapley decomposition, and Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, suggest that informality by itself is a critical factor in explaining the impact of the shock on firms that goes beyond the firms' choice of sector, their size and age. Informal firms driven by necessity witness a larger drop in sales during the shock period compared to the parasitic type of informal firms.\n\nFifth, the adjustment response of informal firms to crisis is lower even after accounting for their lower initial capabilities. In particular, the adoption of digital technology that was a key adjustment response to lockdown restrictions and partially helped firms mitigate the negative demand shock of the crisis was lower in informal firms and particularly the parasite firms. Encouragingly, female-led informal firms were more likely to start the use of digital technologies and sell online but less likely to invest in such technologies.\n\nSixth, Access to public support by informal firms is significantly lower. We also suspect mistargeting in support, given that the probability of accessing support is uncorrelated with initial productivity and positively associated with the level of change in sales. Moreover, the instruments used do not address the underlying factors that make informal firms vulnerable, nor do they use the crisis as an opportunity to provide incentives for firms to formalize.\n\nAlthough a large informal sector is a distinctive characteristic of many developing countries (Perry and Maloney, 2007; La Porta and Shleifer, 2014; Ulyssea, 2020), countries in South Asia exhibit even higher rates of informality (Bussolo et al., 2020) such that more than $90 \\%$ of the businesses in South Asia are informal. Thus, South Asia provides a unique setting for this type of analysis. In addition, South Asia was also among the regions that were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 shock (Brucal et al., 2021). The combination of these two factors reinforces the importance of analyzing the role of informality in explaining firm-level outcomes.\n\nOur study makes four main contributions to the literature. First, our analysis takes advantage of several rounds of novel firm-level data specifically collected to analyze the",
      "5": "COVID-19 shock. We rely on BPS for Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, which includes information that spans from the onset of the crisis and the implementation of lockdown measures to the recovery phase, where mostly all firms were fully open. ${ }^{1}$ Second, we construct a composite measure of informality that accounts for its multidimensionality through the continuous index based on a Tetrachoric Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This approach allows us to measure the degree of informality on a continuum. Third, we distinguish between low-productivity informal firms born out of \"necessity\" versus those that are comparable to formal firms but they still choose to remain informal to evade costs associated with formality (\"parasite\" firms). ${ }^{2}$ Fourth, we separate the role of external attributes and internal characteristics in correlating the effect of the crisis on informal firms.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the literature on the definition and measurement of the informal sector focused on firm informality. In Section 3, we explain the methodological aspects of the analysis, including the unique characteristics of the Business Pulse Survey dataset, the structure of the informality composite index that we propose, and our analysis of measures that differentiate across different views of informality such as necessity, De Soto, and \"parasite\" firms (See Ulyssea, 2018, 2020). We also highlight the identification strategy. Section 4 presents descriptive analyses of the variables of interest in the sample. Section 5 presents the main results of our analysis of the heterogeneous effects of the crisis according to informality, while Section 6 concludes.\n\n# 2. Related Literature \n\n### 2.1 Definition and Measurement of Informality\n\nInformality may include definitions from the perspective of the workers, firms, and government. These may be inter-related but have different implications. On the workers' side, a job that does not provide standard labor protection falls under informality (Perry and Maloney, 2007), while on the firm's side, informality ranges from firms that do not exist in the records of the authorities (entirely under the radar) to much larger firms complying with many regulations, hiring formal workers, but failing to declare some of their revenues and workers to partially avoid some tax payments (La Porta and Shleifer, 2014) which makes them informal from the perspective of government. A wide array of combinations with different degrees of informality exist in between adhering to all regulatory requirements of\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ These data are obtained over three rounds of data collection, except for the case of Afghanistan and Sri Lanka, where political risks prevented us from implementing a third round of surveys.\n    ${ }^{2}$ See Ulyssea $(2018,2020)$.",
      "6": "being fully formal, which makes it a multidimensional concept (Perry and Maloney, 2007; Ulyssea, 2018, 2020).\n\nThe literature uses both macro and micro methods to measure informality. ${ }^{3}$ Our work measures informality from the firm's side and relies on microeconomic approaches that produce disaggregate indicators at the sectoral, regional, and enterprise levels. Given the obvious problems of self-reporting by firms about their non-compliance, proxies (e.g., self-employed and microenterprises) are widely used to measure informality, though with the caveat that very small firms can still comply with the law and be formal (Restrepo Echavarria, 2015). Firm-level surveys that include direct questions about the various forms of informality, such as the one used in our work, can be considered a lower bound of the size of informality (Putninš and Sauka, 2015), given that some firms might misreport (to avoid being on the radar of the government). ${ }^{4}$ However, in most cases, researchers rely on only one aspect of informality ignoring the multidimensional nature of the issue (Restrepo Echavarria, 2015; Perry and Maloney, 2007).\n\n# 2.2 Stylized Facts on Informality \n\nThe informality literature has identified a set of empirical regularities about informality (non-necessarily causal) across developing countries. First, the share of informality in developing countries is large and persistent Ulyssea (2020), accounting for $70 \\%-80 \\%$ of the labor force and about 20\\% of GDP (Loayza, 2018). Second, informal firms tend to be a drag on growth not only because these firms have lower productivity (Perry and Maloney, 2007; La Porta and Shleifer, 2014; La Porta et al., 2008) but also because they use valuable resources leading to misallocation and aggregate productivity losses. Third, informal firms tend to employ low-skilled or low-educated managers and workers (La Porta and Shleifer, 2014; De Mel et al., 2010). Fourth, informal firms lag behind in innovation, investment in new capital, and technology adoption, perhaps due to smaller size and lack of complementary factors (intangibles) such as human capital and managerial capabilities.\n\n### 2.3 Informality Types or Views: Exit and Exclusion\n\nIn exploring the root cause of informality in Latin America, Arias et al. (2010) propose two distinct but complementary lenses: informality driven by 'exclusion' from state benefits vis-\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ See Medina and Schneider (2019) for an example of macroeconomic-focused methods, Medina and Schneider (2018) for a survey of macro methods and Elgin et al. (2021) for a comprehensive database using both model-based and survey-based measures of informality that covers more than 160 economies for the period 1990-2018.\n    ${ }^{4}$ Some surveys use indirect questions about the sector in cases where firms might have strong incentives to provide incorrect responses (Putninš and Sauka, 2015; Gërxhani, 2004; Reilly et al., 2019).",
      "7": "a-vis that driven by voluntary 'exit' decisions resulting from private cost-benefit calculations that lead firms to opt out of formal institutions. The former views informality as resulting from either a \"necessity\" that creates a class of subsistence low-productive firms that would otherwise exit the market to be profitable enough to survive (La Porta and Shleifer, 2014). Alternatively, such informal firms may have untapped potential but excluded from the formal market due to burdensome regulations (De Soto, 1989). By comparison, the latter perceives informal firms as \"parasites\" that have productivity comparable to their formal counterparts but still take advantage of the lower costs of informality to remain more profitable (Levy Algazi et al., 2018). Recent works by Ulyssea $(2018,2020)$ allow for these views of informality to coexist and explain the heterogeneity and complexity of the informality problem in developing countries.\n\n# 2.4 Crisis and Informality \n\nSeveral studies have analyzed the role of the informal sector in the context of crises (e.g., Elgin et al., 2021, 2022) and specifically if it can serve as a safety net in the face of employment losses during shocks. Studies suggest that informality may indeed be a safety net (Loayza and Rigolini, 2011; Colombo et al., 2019; Fernández and Meza, 2015) although it may depend inversely on the size of informality. To the best of our knowledge, so far the evidence on the impact of the pandemic on the informal economy has been limited to macro measures (Ohnsorge and Yu, 2022) or on informal employment or workers (Alfaro et al., 2020, ILO, 2020). The closest work is related to firm-level evidence on the impact of the COVID-19 shock on small firms (Bartik et al., 2020; Humphries et al., 2020; Apedo-Amah et al., 2020; Cirera et al., 2021; Brucal et al., 2021).\n\n## 3. Data and Methodology\n\n### 3.1 Data\n\nTo analyze the role of informality in the context of the COVID-19 crisis, we use data from the World Bank BPS. This survey has collected data for thirty-three months for over 150,000 firms in 87 countries. The BPS survey instrument includes questions that have focused on the different shocks that firms suffered in the aftermath of COVID (change in sales, uncertainty, expectations, supply shocks, financial fragility), the adjustment mechanisms they had to implement (employment adjustments, digitalization, and innovation efforts), as well as the amount and characteristics of the public support received. ${ }^{5}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ It also contains detailed information about firm-level baseline characteristics such as firm size, sector, age, gender of the owner, indebtedness, access to credit, and pre-COVID sales, among other indicators. For details on the first three waves, see Apedo-Amah et al. (2020) and Cirera et al. (2021).",
      "8": "In the case of South Asia, the BPS includes data for six countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, over three waves of data collection. The first one was conducted at the onset of the COVID-19 crisis (between May and July 2020), a follow-up round was collected between May and August 2021, and the third and final round was collected between May and July 2022. The last round was not implemented in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan due to fragile political situations in the two countries (see Figure A1 for the timing of the surveys and Table B1 for the observation count in each round).\n\n# 3.2 Measuring Informality \n\nStarting from the second round, the BPS in South Asia also captures the multidimensional nature of informality by including six questions relating to business license, registration under company law, contributions to employee provident funds, value-added tax (VAT) registration, the firm holding a bank account, and the separation of this account for business use. ${ }^{6}$\n\n### 3.2.1 Informality Composite Index\n\nTo measure the multidimensionality problem of informality, we follow an approach similar to Medvedev and Oviedo (2016) in constructing an informality index that relies on a combination of informality indicators. We take the first component of a Tetrachoric Principal Component Analysis (PCA), given that our informality variables are binary, and build three scores to capture distinct aspects of informality. Such an approach helps reduce the multidimensionality of informality into one index and allows us to build a continuous quantitative measure. The first index, PCA 5, uses all five measures captured in the BPS, except for the bank accounts mix, as this variable is conditional on having a bank account. We build two sub-indices, for robustness checks. PCA 1 restricts to operational indicators that measure the extensive margin of informality (Ulyssea, 2018, 2020) accounting for aspects relating to business license, VAT registration, registration under company law. ${ }^{7}$ PCA 2 focuses on intensive and direct measures of informality (Ulyssea, 2018, 2020) pertaining to a firm's contributions to social insurance schemes and holding a bank account, which may likely suffer less from misreporting issues.\n\nTable B2 shows the tetrachoric correlations, eigenvalues, and factor loadings for the main index and the two subindices. Of the total variance of the main Tetrachoric PCA composite\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ As we cannot track transitions into and out of informality, we are implicitly assuming informality is time-invariant in our analysis.\n    ${ }^{7}$ These dimensions are, initially, more sensitive when asked directly and, therefore, more subject to misreporting as they hold a veil of illegality.",
      "9": "measure (PCA 5), $57.52 \\%$ is explained by the extensive/operational measures of informality (no license, no registration, no VAT registration number). The remaining $42.48 \\%$ is explained by the two intensive proxies of informality (contributions to employees' social security and bank account).\n\n# 3.2.2 Types of Informal Firms: Necessity, Parasite, and De Soto \n\nInformal firms can either be born out of necessity with a survival motive; are parasitic such that they choose to remain informal to evade costs; or are high-potential but per the De Soto view remain informal due to burdensome regulations. The type of informality is correlated with the initial productivity of firms when they enter the market and is contingent on the human capital of the entrepreneurs (Ulyssea, 2018). We use the pre-pandemic productivity measure to analyze the distributions across formal and informal firms. To this end, we take the following steps: First, we regress productivity on firm attributes such as age and other initial characteristics, including size, sector, whether the firm is female-led, and country fixed effects:\n\n$$\n\\log (\\text { sales } / \\text { worker })_{i t_{0}}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} a g e_{i t_{0}}+\\beta_{2} a g e_{i t_{0}}^{2}+\\beta_{3} \\text { female }_{i}+\\gamma_{s}+\\phi_{c}+\\nu_{j}+u_{i t}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\gamma_{s}$ are sector fixed effects; $\\phi_{c}$ are country fixed effects; and $\\nu_{j}$ are size effects, where $j=$ small, medium, and large.\n\nSecond, using the residual of this regression, that is, unexplained labor productivity, we calculate the $25^{\\text {th }}$ and the $75^{\\text {th }}$ percentiles of the distribution of this conditional productivity by country and sector for fully formal firms - on both extensive and intensive margins - as measured by PCA(5).\n\nIn the last step, we map the distribution of informal firms to one of the three groups: below $25^{\\text {th }}$ percentile; between $25^{\\text {th }}$ and $75^{\\text {th }}$ percentile, and; above $75^{\\text {th }}$ percentile. We expect that informal firms below the $25^{\\text {th }}$ percentile threshold should be more similar to necessity or survival firms as they have very low productivity compared with formal firms of similar characteristics.\n\nFor the other two types of informal firms, the distinction is more difficult with our dataset. For example, in contrast with Ulyssea (2018), we do not have the pre-entry productivity signal but labor productivity before the pandemic, implying that the firm has already internalized the cost-benefits trade-offs and decided to remain informal. Given that the costs relative to productivity benefits are lower for parasite firms (compared to De Soto), we expect firms between the bottom and top quartile of the productivity distribution would",
      "10": "fit the De Soto view, where firms have some potential to grow, yet due to burdensome regulations, they are not able to join the formal sector. Firms above the $75^{\\text {th }}$ percentile threshold could be classified as \"parasite\" firms as, conditional on their characteristics, they have a level of productivity comparable to or even higher than the top quartile of formal firms but they still remain in the informal sector. ${ }^{8}$\n\nUnder this framework, we can classify all firms in our sample into four categories: (1) Informal-necessity, (2) Informal-De Soto view, (3) Informal-parasite, and (4) Fully formal. Figure 1, shows the kernel density of this conditional productivity for the four types of firms in our sample, using PCA(5) as the informality index. As expected, the informal firm's productivity distribution has a heavy left tail compared to formal firms that have a thicker right tail. Yet, there is a huge overlap in the productivity distribution across these firms, suggesting that the reasons for staying informal at the lower end of the distribution might be very different than at the higher end. ${ }^{9}$ This also points to the possibility that the shock may not affect all informal firms uniformly.\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of conditional productivity across types of informality\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nSource: Authors' calculations using data from the World Bank Business Pulse Survey (BPS).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ Arguably, our classification hinges on the arbitrary quartile definition, but, in general, firms classified under these three categories are at least similar to the informality view they intend to represent. We also tested a stricter threshold with necessity firms below the minimum of the conditional productivity, and the results (available upon request) do not change much, but standard errors increase significantly due to the smaller number of observations in the necessity category of informality.\n    ${ }^{9}$ By construction, we observe more overlap between the distribution of De Soto type of firms and the distribution of formal firms, while the density for necessity firms is shifted to the left. The classification is constructed at the country-sector level, and this figure pools all countries and sectors together.",
      "11": "# 3.3 Estimation Methods \n\nIt is widely known that informal firms are small, more likely present in certain services sectors with a higher level of participation of women in these sectors, among others. Therefore, we correlate the adverse effect of the pandemic (or the adjustments response of firms) with informality by itself once we control for these firm-level characteristics. We estimate the model shown in equation 2:\n\n$$\ny_{i t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\text { Informality }+\\beta_{j} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i t}+u_{i t}\n$$\n\nThe main controls included in $\\boldsymbol{X}_{\\boldsymbol{i t}}$ are indicator variables to identify microenterprises (less than nine employees), age, sectors, and a female-leadership. We also control for country and time-fixed effects, the severity of the lockdown (using the Google mobility indicator), and a dummy variable for whether the firm is a panel firm. The latter controls for any recall bias in retrospective variables and differences in new firms' characteristics. Our main outcome variable is the change in sales since the start of the pandemic which measures the size of the shock. ${ }^{10}$ We implement a Shorrocks-Shapley decomposition for the change in sales to analyze the relative impact of informality against other firm-level characteristics. ${ }^{11}$\n\nTo understand the heterogeneity in the impact of the shock and the adjustment responses among informal firms, we estimate the model in equation 3:\n\n$$\ny_{i t}=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\text { Informality }_{i}+\\beta_{j} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i t}+\\gamma_{k} \\text { Informality }_{i} * Z_{i t}+u_{i t}\n$$\n\n$Z_{i t}$ is each of the different groups of variables included in vector $\\boldsymbol{X}_{\\boldsymbol{i t}}$ taken separately.\nFinally, we estimate split regressions, to allow for different coefficients for different types of firms (necessity, De Soto, parasite, and fully formal). ${ }^{12}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ In addition to the change in sales, we also consider other outcome variables such as the firm's adjustment response to the pandemic through technology adoption and innovation in products and services.\n    ${ }^{11}$ Such decomposition has been widely used to understand inequality and poverty measures (See Shorrocks and Shorrocks, 1999; Shorrocks, 2013; Sastre and Trannoy, 2002).\n    ${ }^{12}$ To analyze the statistical significance of the differences between coefficients, we also estimate a fullyinteracted model of the types of informality categorical variable, which is equivalent to the split regressions setting.",
      "12": "# 4. Descriptive Statistics \n\nThe descriptive statistics shown in Table B5 suggest that $42 \\%$ of the firms are microenterprises and that the service sector comprises $43 \\%$ of the observations. The hospitality subsector, which was one of the hardest hit sectors in the pandemic, accounts for almost one-third of the firms in the service sector. Among the firms, $40 \\%$ are young (less than five years), $13 \\%$ are maturing (between five and fourteen years), and $47 \\%$ are what we call established (with fifteen years or more in the market). Only about one-fifth of the firms in our sample are female-led.\n\nThe primary outcome of interest, the change in sales compared to the value before the pandemic, has been previously studied in (Apedo-Amah et al., 2020; Cirera et al., 2021). The three rounds of data show that, on average, and without controlling for any other factor, firms exhibit a decrease of $29 \\%$ percentage points against their pre-pandemic level. This value, of course, includes periods of recovery. We also analyze recovery for the last two rounds, measured as $\\Delta$ Change in sales $_{t, t-1}$. Though recovery is, on average, around 11 percentage points, the median is still zero, indicating that half of the firms have not recovered and that the dispersion of recovery is very high with the standard deviation being around four times the mean, which underscores the need to analyze sources of heterogeneity in recovery after shocks.\n\nIn addition to the firm outcomes affected by the shock, we also consider variables related to the adjustment response by firms (e.g., use of digital technologies) and access to public support. About $50 \\%$ of the firms started or increased their use of digital technologies, and $61 \\%$ report having online sales. Only $22 \\%$ of firms report having received support from the government, which varied widely across the three rounds. ${ }^{13}$\n\n## 5. Results\n\n### 5.1 Informal firms tend to be smaller, in sectors with low entry costs (retail and services) and also younger\n\nInformality is highly correlated with small businesses (see, for example, La Porta and Shleifer, 2014; Ulyssea, 2018, 2020). The BPS data for South Asia shows that the share of microenterprises (fewer than nine employees) in the formal sector, after controlling for firm characteristics such as sector, country, time, and age, is $38 \\%$. This contrasts sharply\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{13}$ During the first round, on average, only $5 \\%$ of the firms received support, while for the second round, support increased to around $20 \\%$ of the firms.",

Informal firms also tend to be relatively younger than formal firms perhaps because of faster churning in the informal sector (Figure 2, panel c), while nearly half of the firms in the formal sector are established (with more than 15 years in operations). This result is consistent with the recent findings in Vietnam (Mccaig and Pavcnik, 2021) where entry and exit are relatively higher in the informal sector compared to that observed in the formal sector.\n\nGiven that the attributes of our sample from BPS data are in line with documented evidence about informal firms we are confident that our data are suitable for analysis on informality.\n\nFigure 2: Characteristics of firms by type of informality\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nNotes: Controlling by wave, country, severity of the crises and other firm-level characteristics, except the one depicted in each panel.

      "14": "# 5.2 Informal firms have lower productivity, with consistently lower levels of management and technological capabilities across all types of informal firms \n\nConsistent with the finding in the literature that informal firms are highly inefficient (La Porta and Shleifer, 2014), the BPS data for South Asia shows that informal firms are largely present in the first two terciles of pre-pandemic labor productivity (Figure 3, panel a) ${ }^{15}$ and that there is a clear negative relationship between the degree of informality and productivity (Figure 3, panel b). ${ }^{16}$\n\nFigure 3: Informality according to normalized polychoric PCA 5 vs. labor productivity\n(a) Proportion of formal and informal by tercile of labor\n(b) Labor productivity vs. Informality productivity\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nNotes: Panel (a) classifies as informal firms those with a value above the median in our continuous measure of informality (PCA 5) Panel (b) controls for size, sector, age, country, and severity of the crisis.\nSource: Authors' calculations using data from the World Bank Business Pulse Survey (BPS).\n\nThese results hold consistently for other predictors of firms' total factor productivity, such as managerial capabilities (see Bloom et al., 2019, 2022; Grover and Torre, 2019) and technological readiness. ${ }^{17}$ Management and digital readiness are negatively correlated with the degree of informality (Figure 4, panels a and b), and especially so for parasite firms.

While we present the results using PCA 5 as a measure of informality, they are robust to using other alternative measures (PCA 1 and PCA 2, as shown in Figures A4 and A5 of the Online Appendix. Technological readiness is computed based on the pre-pandemic period status of firms' use of digital payments solutions, social media, or big data analytics for marketing and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) for business administration and operations.",

That is, the selection mechanism through which more capable firms survive and grow is at work; however, informal firms exhibit a weaker sizemanagement relationship indicating that there is some degree of misallocation perpetuated due to informality, particularly by parasite firms where this relationship is the weakest. A similar pattern is also observed with respect to digital readiness (Figure 5, panel b). This suggests that the faster churning in the informal sector is not necessarily linked to productivity improvements, as also evidenced in Vietnam (Mccaig and Pavcnik, 2021).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{18}$ In terms of educational distribution, fully formal firms exhibit a much higher proportion of managers with a college degree compared to informal firms (Figure A6).",

These results are comparable across the various types of informal firms, with the necessity firms being hit slightly harder. Nevertheless, there is a tight negative correlation between the degree of informality and the change in sales, pooling the three waves together (Figure 6, panel b). Similar results are obtained with respect to recovery across waves ( $\\Delta$ Change in sales $_{t, t-1}$ ), that is, as the degree of informality increases, recovery is slower (Figure A7).\n\nThe external attributes of firms that are associated with informality are also the ones that have been negatively associated with firm performance during the pandemic. For example, micro and small firms witnessed a larger drop their sales and a slower recovery (Cirera et al., 2021). Given that when data are limited such attributes are used as proxy for informality, (e.g., Perry and Maloney (2007) justifies using firm size to indicate informality because \"most microenterprises are informal\"), we test if the poor performance of firms during crisis is explained by factors in addition to these attributes.

If we further condition by initial labor productivity (column 2), the magnitude does not change much. This indicates that even though an important part of the performance of firms can indeed be explained by their characteristics, as the coefficient on informality reduces significantly from the unconditional ( $-36 \\%$ ) to the conditional specification, there is still a role for informality by itself. ${ }^{19}$ Within the types of informal firms, those driven by necessity have worse performance, an average four-percentage points difference against parasite firms (columns 3 and 4). Recovery exhibits a similar pattern, with fully informal firms showing a much worse performance, even after controlling for initial productivity (columns 5-8).\n\nTo understand the role of each firm attribute, we extend our regression framework to also include interactions of these traits with informality, one at a time.

      "25": "Split regressions that interact firm attributes with informality (Table 5) consistently suggest that female-led informal businesses have a higher probability of starting or increasing their use of digital and selling online but are less likely to invest in digital technologies. These results are broadly observed in fully-interacted models as well (See Table B8).\n\n# 5.5 Access to public support by informal firms is limited and not necessarily targeted to alleviate the most pressing internal constraint \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic prompted an unprecedented amount of government support where decisions regarding the scope, targeting, policy instruments had to be mobilized in a very short span of time. As the crisis unfolded, the support provided to firms increased, but with important country-level heterogeneity (Cirera et al., 2021). On average, and across the three rounds of the survey, about $22 \\%$ of the firms in South Asia received public support (Table B5). Informal firms have nearly 8 percentage points lower probability of receiving public support than that observed for formal firms (Table 6, column 1), with all types of informal firms being equally hurt (column 3). The probability of accessing support appears to be uncorrelated with initial productivity but positively associated with the level of change in sales (Table 6, column 2). ${ }^{21}$ Both these factors are suggestive of mistargeting in the allocation of support. ${ }^{22}$\n\n### 5.6 Robustness\n\nTo test the robustness of our results, we conduct a large set of additional exercises.\nRestricted sample: Given that India has a much larger sample compared to the other countries in our sample, we re-estimated our specifications, excluding India. With this change, the magnitude of the coefficients is within the one percentage point range of the base specification, and our conclusions remain robust. ${ }^{23}$\n\nBalanced panel: We test whether the unbalanced panel structure could be driving our results in a number of ways. First, we restrict our sample to firms that appear three times in our dataset (balanced panel), which reduces our sample size significantly. Second, we drop firms that appear only once in our sample.

We tested with alternative thresholds, for example, top and bottom $30 \\%$ or top and bottom $20 \\%$. In all cases, our results remain robust, with the magnitude of the coefficients being within the one percentage point range of the base model.\n\nAlternative definition of informality: A final robustness check is related to using a sharper definition of informality following Ulyssea (2018) and Ulyssea (2020). To do this, we define an extensive margin as those firms that do not have a registration and do not pay taxes. We use an intensive margin definition identifying among those that are formal on the extensive margin, which ones do not provide social security for their workers or do not use a bank account. Our results using such dichotomous variables (instead of the ones from continuous measures or types of informality) show very similar magnitudes.",
      "27": "# 6. Conclusions \n\nUsing three waves of Business Pulse Survey data collected in South Asia during the COVID19 crisis, we disentangle the impact of the shock on informal firms, their adjustment response, and the reasons underlying their fragility. We construct a measure of informality that captures its multidimensionality. In our analysis, we also incorporate the various views characterizing informality by comparing the pre-pandemic productivity distribution of these firms - necessity, De Soto, and parasite firms - with that of formal firms. These features allow us to test the heterogeneity in impact, recovery, and response to the pandemic by the degree of informality (our composite index) and the type or motivation for informality.\n\nBefore delving into analyzing the impact of the crisis, we compare the stylized facts on informality using our survey data. In line with the existing literature, our data confirm that informal firms, as defined by our composite index, tend to be smaller in size, relatively younger, and more prevalent in sectors with low entry costs. Additionally, informal firms have lower labor productivity, possibly driven by poor management capabilities and digital readiness. Such lack of capabilities potentially makes informal firms more vulnerable to shocks even after accounting for external attributes. That is, informality by itself leads to worse outcomes and, in particular, for firms driven by necessity that remain subsistence. These factors also limit the adjustment response to shocks. For instance, the gap between formal and informal in terms of digital adoption is not only salient prior to the pandemic but also widening.\n\nGiven our finding that size cannot proxy for informality due to the multi-dimensional nature of the problem, we propose considering the following aspects in supporting the private sector in the context of informality:\n\nTargeting - Who to support: In general, sector or firm selection can be distortionary; however, during shocks the efficiency of instruments can be most effective for the industry or group of firms that are most affected. Based on our analysis, we suggest that considering the severity and type of informality is critical in assessing the modality and instrument for support. For instance, although necessity firms are particularly vulnerable, support for these firms should consider approaches similar to those used for helping households (e.g., cash transfers). By comparison, the De Soto and Parasite firms lag behind in their adjustment response to the pandemic and may be eligible for support on digitization. The selection of sector or firm groups should be carefully evaluated after supply-chain analysis and focus on strengthening the weak linkages, where the failure of a few key firms in a value chain can have big repercussions for the rest of the economy.",
      "28": "Modality - How to support: First, crowding in the private sector is crucial to help firms during the crisis and especially when governments face tighter fiscal space. For instance, several Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) supported firms during the COVID-19 pandemic, including large and mid-sized ones. Support to large and mid-sized firms can be made conditional on passing on some benefits to their key suppliers who remain informal (mainly due to regulatory burdens). Second, scaling up access to finance for informal businesses could be critical, given the fragility and credit crunch during the crisis. Governments or Multilateral Development Institutions may be able to avoid direct targeting by ramping up credit through financial institutions. However, concessional finance to financial institutions by DFIs can be made conditional on supporting certain types of informal businesses.\n\nInstruments - What to support: Our results suggest that relative to the formal sector, informal firms have lower levels of management capabilities and lag behind in digital readiness, which makes them even more vulnerable during the shock. Such crises are an opportunity to reduce this capabilities gap. There are three possible market failures that hinder the adoption of technology among informal firms: (i) information gaps: firms do not have information on the possible technology/adjustment models (ii) capabilities failure: firms do not have the required skills to adopt technology or adjust business models, and (iii) credit market failure: financial institutions may not lend for upgrading programs as their value may not be known or intangible. Although informal firms face such gaps in capabilities, the support reaching them barely addresses these issues. ${ }^{24}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{24}$ Some examples of support in this intervention include skills training and providing access to inexpensive smartphones with a short-term subscription. Improving the capabilities of informal firms can enhance their resilience to shocks and potentially encourage formalization in the long run.",

Considerable interest has developed in understanding the consequences of such reforms. This paper constructs a dynamic general equilibrium model to assess the size of distortions and other quantitative implications associated with a transaction tax. The distinctive feature of the model is the non-neutrality property of the tax in the sense that it distorts the structure of relative prices of intermediate transactions, giving rise to tax \"pyramidation.\" The effective tax rate ultimately borne by the economy is shown to depend on the complexity of the transaction structure. Calibrated for Latin America, the model finds that, contrary to existing evidence and conventional wisdom, a transaction tax is not a particularly burdensome levy in terms of economic growth and efficiency costs. The model also shows that if a government can credibly commit itself to an announced two-step reform in which it first uses a transaction tax temporarily and then replaces it with any other conventional tax, this policy will improve economic welfare relative to a tax reform where a consumption tax (or a labor income tax or a capital earnings tax) is exclusively used from the start to raise the required additional revenue.\n\n\nJEL classification numbers: B22, E62, H22\nKeywords: tax reform, transaction tax, tax pyramidation, cascading tax\n\nWorld Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3279, April 2004\n\nThe Policy Research Working Paper Series disseminates the findings of work in progress to encourage the exchange of ideas about development issues.

      "1": "# 1. INTRODUCTION \n\nA few months before the 2002 collapse of the currency peg, the Argentine government, in an attempt to make the Convertibility Plan more credible, passed a series of reforms including the introduction of a temporary tax on bank account debit and credit transactions. The Colombian government, in the middle of a financial crisis in 1998, introduced a temporary tax on transactions conducted through financial intermediaries to finance the bailout of mortgage, mutual and state-owned banks. In 1993, the Brazilian government created a new temporary tax on financial transactions to provide for universal health care coverage, a right given by a constitutional amendment passed in 1988. In 2002, the Venezuelan government instated a temporary bank debit tax to ease pressing budgetary imbalances. Today, all these countries have a form of tax on financial transactions in their codes, sometimes on a permanent basis (Colombia), sometimes continuously renewed on a temporary basis (Brazil), sometimes scrapped and then reinstated (Argentina and Venezuela) and sometimes earmarked for new purposes (e.g., Colombia).\n\nOther countries in Latin America have resorted to bank debit taxation in the past. To ameliorate the effect of the collapse of world oil prices on the budget, Ecuador abolished its income tax system in 1998 and replaced it with a financial transaction tax, in hopes of increasing revenue. The income tax was soon reinstated and the transaction tax scrapped in 2001. Peru made use of this type of tax at the beginning of the 1990s and a proposal for its reintroduction has recently been approved by the government.\n\nBank debit taxation has had a bumpy ride in the region. After starting with enormous design problems that literally shut down foreign exchange, interbank and stock markets in some countries, and after numerous reforms directed at converting it into a more palatable levy (for instance, by exempting foreign exchange and stock market trades, transactions with the central bank, the treasury and other government agencies, investment funds, etc.), the most recent versions of the tax have gathered momentum and represent an important source of revenue for governments. In 2002, the contribution of bank debit taxes to federal government tax revenue came to $12.7 \\%$ in Venezuela, $9.6 \\%$ in Argentina, $6.1 \\%$ in Brazil and $5.3 \\%$ in Colombia. If the yield of other indirect \"cascading\" taxes is added, turnover taxes represent almost $23 \\%$ of the government's tax revenue in Brazil.\n\nAlthough there is no more than a handful of empirical studies, the policy debate in the region, based on them, has been characterized by unequivocal and definite policy statements. According to the literature, a transaction tax is a particularly burdensome levy (Albuquerque, 2001a and 2001b; Arbeláez et al., 2002; Coelho et al., 2001; Lozano and Ramos, 2000; Koyama and Nakane, 2001), and its costs are higher the longer it remains in place (Kirilenko and Summers, 2003; Tanzi, 2000). It is strongly recommended that the tax be scrapped soon (Coelho, et al. 2001; IMF, 2000; Tanzi, 2000) and replaced with taxes such as the VAT and income taxes (Coelho, et al. 2001). However, the lack of theoretical and empirical analyses backing up such statements is surprising. The existing literature has not been able to address key issues, such as how a transaction tax distorts",
      "2": "the allocation of economic resources, how big the resulting distortion (excess burden) is, how badly a transaction tax fares relative to the VAT and income taxes or how the economy behaves along the transition path of tax reforms involving changes in the transaction tax. This paper attempts to make such analyses, providing quantitative answers rather than conjectures.\n\nA bank debit tax is a convoluted object. Albuquerque (2001a; 2001b) and Kirilenko and Summers (2003) have approached some of the questions at issue from a narrow perspective, understanding it as an excise tax on financial intermediation. In contrast, this paper interprets a bank debit tax more broadly, as a transaction tax, and disregards its effect on financial intermediation to focus on real resource allocation. A bank debit tax akin to a transaction tax - has features that are similar to conventional taxes like a tax on final expenditures, a tax on labor income and a tax on capital earnings, but it also exhibits the less desirable features of a turnover tax. These latter features are what make a bank debit tax a cascading tax, which is highly objectionable. Long ago, economic theory showed that final good taxation is superior to turnover or transaction taxation because it avoids production inefficiency (Diamond and Mirrlees, 1971). In contrast to a consumerconsumer (financial) transaction tax and a value-added tax applied to all stages of production and distribution, a turnover tax suffers from a non-neutrality property in the sense that it distorts the structure of relative prices of intermediate transactions conducted on the production side of the economy. This explains the strong preference economic theory has for a value-added tax within the class of indirect taxes, and also why policy makers and analysts take for granted the superiority, on efficiency grounds, of other tax instruments and why little is known about the nature and size of the distortionary effects caused by tax \"pyramidation.\"\n\nThis paper introduces into a multisector, dynamic general equilibrium model a transaction tax to assess the size of distortions, the effect on economic growth and the efficiency costs associated with alternative tax reforms involving a transaction tax. The contribution and distinctive feature of the model is the non-neutrality property of the modeled tax that gives rise to tax pyramidation. This feature has not been properly captured by standard tax models, which typically ignore intermediate transactions and, more importantly, unconventional taxes, like a transaction tax. The paper shows that the effective tax burden in the economy depends on the complexity of the transaction structure. The model also constructs a level playing field in which conventional taxes levied on final transactions, such as a consumption tax, and taxes such as labor and capital income taxes, on the one hand, and unconventional taxes levied on both final and intermediate transactions, on the other, can be judiciously compared.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the model, first focusing on the properties of transaction taxation and then generalizing it by including consumption, labor income and capital earnings taxes. Section 3 explains the parameterization strategy, the solution algorithm to compute equilibrium allocations and the metric used to compare the effects of alternative tax reforms. Section 4 presents and discusses the main results from numerical experiments and performs some robustness checks. Section 5 presents the results of additional numerical sensitivity analyses. An effort is made to reconcile the",
      "3": "results in this paper with the strikingly opposing conclusions drawn from the existing empirical literature in Section 6. Finally, conclusions are contained in Section 7.\n\n# 2. THE MODEL \n\nThree general types of transactions are carried out in our economy: one between firms conducting intermediate input trade, one between firms and households buying and selling capital and labor services and finally, one between firms and households exchanging final consumption and investment goods. All these types of transactions are intermediated through the financial system and therefore, subject to a bank debit tax, which is called hereafter, transaction tax (TT). This means that every single trade taking place in either the final good market, or the intermediate good market, or the capital market or the labor market is burdened with a TT. The salient feature of a transaction tax is its potential to cause distortions in trading patterns through the \"pyramiding\" of nominal rates, i.e., its feature that resembles a turnover tax. In the model economy, this feature is captured by taxing intermediate input transactions. Given the assumed production structure - to be described shortly - the tax rate will pyramid as a good \"turns over\" from one stage of the production process to the next.\n\n## A. Production and Transaction Structures\n\nThe production structure is partially inspired by that described by Uribe (1997). There is a fixed, though possibly large, number of sectors $n$ in the economy. The first $n-1$ sectors produce intermediate goods while the final good is produced in the remaining sector, called sector number n . It takes n stages to produce a final homogeneous consumption-investment good and each stage takes place successively from stage 1 in sector 1 to stage $n$ in sector $n$, within a given time period. Since firms solve static problems, the use of time subscripts will be postponed until the time dimension is no longer trivial.\n\nThe production of the final good in sector n requires, in addition to primary factors capital and labor - an intermediate input produced in sector $\\mathrm{n}-1$. The production of the (intermediate) good number $\\mathrm{n}-1$ requires in turn primary inputs and material input produced in sector $\\mathrm{n}-2$ whose production in turn requires materials from sector $\\mathrm{n}-3$, in conjunction with capital and labor services, and successively so for the remaining sectors. This does not apply to sector number 1 , obviously. Sector number 1 production technology involves solely primary inputs. All payments on the production side of the economy are subject to a transaction tax at a rate of $\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}$. Payments include disbursements to pay for primary factor services as well as for the cost of intermediate inputs. This simple structure captures the unpleasant feature of a turnover tax: the tendency of the nominal rate to pyramid.\n\nValue added in sector $i, V_{i}$, is measured as the contribution of primary inputs and technology in the production process. In order to have a unique index of value added,",
      "4": "Sato (1976) shows that two assumptions are needed: separability and generalized homogeneity. Thus, primary inputs and technology are jointly separable from intermediate inputs and the production function is homogeneous of degree one in $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ and $\\mathrm{M}_{\\mathrm{i}}$, where $\\mathrm{M}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ represents intermediate inputs in the production of good $\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{i}=2, \\ldots, \\mathrm{n}$. The economy's technologies satisfy these requirements. The value added function is described by a standard Cobb-Douglas function, common to all sectors, of the form: $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{i}}^{\\mathrm{u}}\\left(\\mathrm{ZH}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)^{\\mathrm{i}-\\alpha}$ where $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is capital in place in sector $\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is raw labor input and Z is an index of knowledge which is freely available to all sectors and which is acquired through learning-by-doing, as a non-deliberate action. Technical change is endogenously determined by means of this externality effect.\n\nGross output $\\mathrm{Y}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ is produced according to a Leontief technology the arguments of which are value added $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ and material input $\\mathrm{M}_{\\mathrm{i}}$. As mentioned above, the latter is produced in sector $\\mathrm{i}-1$. The production structure is concisely expressed as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& Y_{i}=V_{i} \\\\\n& Y_{i}=\\min \\left\\{V_{i}, M_{i}\\right\\} \\quad i=2, \\ldots, n\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn sector number 1 gross output and value added are equal. Let $\\mathrm{p}_{\\mathrm{i}}, \\mathrm{r}$ and w denote the relative price of good i , the rental price of capital and the wage rate all in terms of the final good. Taking prices parametrically, sector i firm chooses $\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ and $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ so as to maximize after-tax profits,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\max \\Pi_{i}=\\left(p_{i}-\\left(1+\\tau^{T}\\right) p_{i-1}\\right) K_{i}^{\\mathrm{u}}\\left(Z H_{i}\\right)^{i-\\alpha}-\\left(1+\\tau^{T}\\right)\\left(r K_{i}+w Z H_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& K_{i}, H_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSector i firm pays taxes of $\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}} \\cdot\\left(\\mathrm{p}_{\\mathrm{i}-1} \\mathrm{M}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)$ on the total transactions conducted in the intermediate input market and of $\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}} \\cdot\\left(\\mathrm{rK}_{\\mathrm{i}}+\\mathrm{wZH}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)$ on trades conducted in primary factor markets. From this problem, the following equilibrium pricing functions are obtained. In sector 1:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\left(1+\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}\\right) \\mathrm{r}=\\mathrm{p}_{\\mathrm{i}} \\alpha\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ZH}_{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\mathrm{~K}_{\\mathrm{i}}}\\right)^{\\mathrm{i}-\\alpha} \\\\\n& \\left(1+\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}\\right) \\mathrm{w}=\\mathrm{p}_{\\mathrm{i}}(1-\\alpha)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\mathrm{ZH}_{\\mathrm{i}}}\\right)^{\\alpha}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand in any other sector $i, i \\neq 1$,",

In our new twist, the marginal cost includes a transaction tax and, in addition the marginal contribution of sectoral primary inputs represent their contribution to a quantum index of aggregate value added. Combine first order conditions to get\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{w}}{\\mathrm{r}}=\\left(\\frac{1-\\alpha}{\\alpha}\\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\mathrm{ZH}_{\\mathrm{i}}} \\quad \\mathrm{i}=1, \\ldots, \\mathrm{n}\n$$\n\nan expression that conveys the main message of the separability assumption: the marginal rate of substitution between primary inputs is independent of the material input $\\mathrm{M}_{\\mathrm{i}}$. The equation says that all sectors utilize the same capital-labor ratio. This key finding is summarized as follows.\n\nProposition 1. Consider the described production and transaction structures. Then, given primary factor prices, capital-labor ratios across the economy are independent of the transaction tax rate.\n\nIn equilibrium, factor prices are determined endogenously and through this channel a TT may exert its distortionary effect on allocations. Identical capital-labor ratios along with Leontief technologies imply that all sectors hire the same amounts of capital and labor\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\mathrm{K}^{\\mathrm{f}} & \\forall \\mathrm{i} \\\\\n\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{i}}=\\mathrm{H}^{\\mathrm{f}} & \\forall \\mathrm{i}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{K}^{\\mathrm{f}}$ and $\\mathrm{H}^{\\mathrm{f}}$ stand for equilibrium factor demands.

Consider the described production structure and Proposition 1. Then, in equilibrium, intermediate input prices $\\left(\\mathrm{p}_{1}, \\mathrm{p}_{2}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{p}_{\\mathrm{n}-1}\\right)$ are exclusively determined by two parameters: n and $\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}$.\n\nProof: The first order conditions for the optimal choice problem for the allocation of capital is made up of a system of n equations",

The $\\mathrm{n}=1$-line may be interpreted as the case of conventional taxation where taxes are levied on final output (i.e. equivalent to a proportional income tax). A $0.3 \\%$ nominal tax rate on final output yields revenue equal to exactly $0.3 \\%$ of GDP (this should be a $45^{\\circ}$ line), hence effective and nominal rates are equal. When intermediate transactions are taxed $(\\mathrm{n}>1)$ a wedge between effective and nominal rates appears. In this case, the line in the $\\left(\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}, \\tau_{\\mathrm{e}}^{\\mathrm{T}}\\right)$-plane rotates counterclockwise and the wedge increases as the transaction and production structures turn more complex (i.e., as n increases). Thus, the overall tax burden expands. The same $0.3 \\%$ nominal TT rate implies an effective tax rate of $0.9 \\%$ when the number of production or transaction stages is 5 , and of $1.64 \\%$ and $3.12 \\%$ when the number of stages are 10 and 20 , respectively. The nominal tax rate indeed pyramids in our model economy.\n\n# B. The Representative Household's Problem \n\nSo far, only the production side of the economy has been described. What follows is the description of how a transaction tax distorts trades in which households and firms interact by exchanging goods and factor services. The representative household's problem is standard. The only minor difference is that households now have to provide capital and labor services to n production sectors in the economy. Following convention, lower case letters (except prices) represent variables under the household's control while capital letters represent their aggregate, per capita counterparts.\n\nThe representative household maximizes intertemporal utility by choosing time paths for consumption $c_{t}$, leisure $l_{t}$, labor supply $h_{1, t}, \\ldots, h_{n, t}$, investment $i_{1, t}, \\ldots, i_{n, t}$ and capital stocks $\\mathrm{k}_{1, \\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{k}_{2, \\mathrm{t}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{n}, \\mathrm{t}}$, taking as given initial stocks of capital - assumed equal across sectors - and fiscal policies described by time paths for tax rates and lump-sum government transfers $\\left\\{\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}, \\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{t}=0}^{\\infty}$. Mathematically, the household's problem is formulated as choosing $\\left\\{\\mathrm{c}_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{l}_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{h}_{1, \\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{h}_{2, \\mathrm{t}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{h}_{\\mathrm{n}, \\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{i}_{1, \\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{i}_{2, \\mathrm{t}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{i}_{\\mathrm{n}, \\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{k}_{1, \\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{k}_{2, \\mathrm{t}}, \\ldots, \\mathrm{k}_{\\mathrm{n}, \\mathrm{t}}\\right\\}_{\\mathrm{t}=0}^{\\infty}$ to maximize\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{W}=\\sum_{\\mathrm{t} \\geq 0} \\beta^{\\mathrm{t}} \\mathrm{u}\\left(\\mathrm{c}_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{l}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis objective represents an intertemporal criterion to evaluate alternative time-dated streams of consumption and leisure where $\\beta$ is a subjective discount factor and $\\mathrm{u}\\left(\\mathrm{c}_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{l}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right)$ is an instantaneous utility function.

As a result, the dimensionality of the problem can be substantially reduced since it is isomorphic to one with one sector.\n\n# C. Endogenous Growth \n\nEndogenous growth is shored up with an externality effect. Since the empirical literature does not seem to privilege a particular source of technical change, four possible alternative mechanisms for engendering sustained growth are appraised. Three invoke the existence of a human capital accumulation process in which learning may come from work experience (learning by working), or investment experience (learning by investing) or production experience (learning by producing). The remaining one invokes a pure positive externality (Romer, 1986) in which disembodied knowledge is represented by the aggregate capital stock. Formally,",

Introducing Conventional Taxation \n\nNow generalize the preceding multisector economy by introducing conventional taxation. In addition to a transaction tax, the government may also resort to other distortionary but better known taxes: a consumption tax at rate of $\\tau^{\\mathrm{C}}$, a labor income tax at rate $\\tau^{\\mathrm{W}}$ and a capital income tax at rate of $\\tau^{\\mathrm{K}}$. The introduction of these new taxes does not change the set-up on the production side of the economy.

      "13": "consumption, labor earnings and capital income taxes performing simultaneously. However, the distortionary effect of a transaction tax goes beyond the combination of traditional taxes. In contrast to conventional taxes, a TT distorts further allocations by treating depreciation allowances as taxable income (SYS.2') and by driving a wedge of inefficiency between rental prices and marginal productivities ((SYS.6) and (SYS.7)) thus affecting primary factor pricing. The size of the wedge reflects the expanded tax burden associated with the degree of cascading. Is, then, transaction taxation more distortionary? It is not possible to provide an answer just by examining how a TT distorts different margins in a general equilibrium system. In the following, this paper provides a quantitative answer.\n\n# 3. CALIBRATION, COMPUTATION AND WELFARE CALCULATION \n\nThis section describes the procedure used to select parameter values, the solution method to compute dynamic allocations of an infinite-horizon general equilibrium model and the metric employed for welfare comparisons among economies with alternative tax regimes.\n\n## A. Parameter Calibration\n\nThe benchmark parameterization is based on data from Brazil, which is the largest economy in the region with a bank debit tax currently in effect. Sensitivity analysis is also performed to check for robustness to alternative parameterizations built on data from other countries that have resorted to this type of unconventional tax.\n\nThe parameterization procedure picks parameter values so as to equate Brazilian average aggregate variables to equivalent magnitudes for the steady state of the model economy. Table 1 details the Brazilian information required to calibrate all parameter values. In general, aggregate target variables are calculated as averages of time series over the 1972-1993 period, before the introduction of the bank debit tax into the tax code in 1993-94. Thus, benchmark parameter choices imply that the model economy's steady state and the Brazilian economy prior to the introduction of a transaction tax will share the same capital-GDP ratio, consumption-GDP ratio, capital income tax-GDP ratio, labor income tax-GDP ratio, consumption tax-GDP ratio, real rate of return, growth rate, etc. The model is calibrated so that the length of a model period is one year.\n\nBefore proceeding further, notice that an important parameter in the model, n, the number of production sectors which in turn determines the degree of tax pyramidation, is calibrated differently. Using the expression given in footnote 2 where the left-hand side is renamed as TRO - transaction tax revenue to output ratio - yields a nonlinear equation in n if information on $\\tau^{\\top}$ and TRO is available:\n\n$$\n\\left(1+\\tau^{\\top}\\right)^{\\mathrm{n}}=1+\\left(\\frac{\\tau^{\\top}}{1+\\tau^{\\top}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\tau^{\\top}-\\mathrm{TRO}}\\right) \\mathrm{n}\n$$",
      "14": "This information is taken from Kirilenko and Summers (2003). They report that in 2001 Brazil's bank debit tax yield was $1.45 \\%$ of GDP with a statutory tax rate of $0.37 \\%$. Figure 2 depicts this simple rootfinding problem. The equation has two roots, being $\\mathrm{n} \\approx 5$ the economically meaningful one. Again, sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess how results are affected by more complex transaction environments.\n\nFrom the steady state version of the law of motion of the aggregate capital stock, equation (SYS.4), an expression for the rate of depreciation of the stock of physical capital is obtained: $\\delta=1-(1-((1-\\mathrm{COR}) / \\mathrm{KOR})) \\cdot \\eta^{\\text {ss }}$, where $\\eta^{\\text {ss }}-1$ is the steady state growth rate of per capita GDP, COR is the consumption-output ratio and KOR is the capital-output ratio. The rate of growth of per capita GDP is evaluated at $2.22 \\%$ which corresponds to the average value calculated for the 1972-1993 sample using World Bank data on GDP and population. From the same database and for the same time period, COR is estimated at $73.6 \\%$. KOR is fixed at 2.68 which corresponds to the average ratio for the 1972-1990 period using Dhareshwar and Nehru's (1993) data. Thus, $\\delta$ is set at $7.84 \\%$.\n\nUsing time series of the Selic rate (return on government bonds) for 1980-2000, Kanczuk (2002) finds that the real interest rate is close to $8 \\%$ ( $1.9 \\%$ on a quarterly basis). This estimate is taken as proxy for the economy's real rate of return RRR. The real rate of return and the marginal product of capital are related simply as RRR $=\\mathrm{r}^{\\text {ss }}-\\delta$. This along with (SYS.6) yields an expression for the capital's share in output, $\\alpha=($ RRR $+\\delta) \\cdot\\left(\\mathrm{KOR} / \\eta^{\\text {ss }}\\right) . \\alpha$ is then set equal to $41.55 \\% . \\tau^{\\mathrm{K}}$ is set to $5.57 \\%$ since, by definition, $\\tau^{\\mathrm{K}}=\\mathrm{KRO} /(\\mathrm{RRR} \\cdot \\mathrm{KOR})$ where KRO is the ratio of capital income tax to output. KRO is calculated as the average ratio of taxes on corporate income, profits and capital gains and nominal GDP for the 1980-1993 period. The sources for tax data are the World Bank's World Development Indicators database and the IMF's Government Finance Statistics (GFS) database. Nominal GDP is taken from World Bank data. The level of government on which tax revenue data is based is what the IMF defines as \"consolidated central government.\" In addition, equation (SYS.2*) delivers an expression to compute $\\beta,\\left(\\eta^{\\text {ss }} / \\beta\\right)=1+\\left(1-\\tau^{\\mathrm{K}}\\right) \\cdot$ RRR . This implies $\\beta=0.95$.\n\nOn the preference side, an expression for $\\theta$ in the utility function can be determined from (SYS.1*):\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}=\\left(\\frac{1+\\tau^{\\mathrm{C}}}{1-\\tau^{\\mathrm{W}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{H}^{\\mathrm{ss}}}{1-\\mathrm{H}^{\\mathrm{ss}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{COR}}{1-\\alpha}\\right)\n$$\n\nValues for average tax rates included in the preceding expression are computed from accounting identities, i.e., $\\tau^{\\mathrm{C}}=\\mathrm{CRO} / \\mathrm{COR}$ and $\\tau^{\\mathrm{W}}=\\mathrm{WRO} /(1-\\alpha)$ where CRO stands for the average collection of consumption taxes relative to GDP and WRO represents a similar ratio for labor income tax revenue. The definition of consumption taxes corresponds to domestic taxes on goods and services in the GFS database while that of",
      "15": "labor income taxes corresponds to the sum of taxes on individual income, profits and capital gains and social security contributions, both of which (taxes and contributions) are interpreted as being levied mainly on labor income. Hence, $\\tau^{\\mathrm{C}}$ is set equal to $7.67 \\%$ and $\\tau^{\\mathrm{W}}$ to $14.79 \\%$. Finally, Ellery et al. (2002), using the National Survey by Household Sample, find that, on average, Brazilian households spend $1 / 3$ of their nonsleeping hours working, implying $\\mathrm{H}^{\\text {ss }}=0.33$. Putting all pieces of information together leads us to calculate $\\theta=0.44$.\n\nThe four alternative growth models will exhibit exactly the same benchmark parameterization (with the obvious exception of the parameters in equation (SYS.5)) and associated steady state if the steady state capital stock is normalized to unity, $\\hat{\\mathrm{K}}^{\\mathrm{ss}}=1$. Consistent with this normalization, steady state aggregate value added is computed as $\\hat{\\mathrm{Y}}^{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\mathrm{KOR}^{-1}$, aggregate consumption as $\\hat{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\mathrm{COR} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathrm{Y}}^{\\mathrm{ss}}$ and investment as $\\hat{\\mathrm{I}}^{\\mathrm{ss}}=(1-\\mathrm{COR}) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathrm{Y}}^{\\mathrm{ss}}$. This normalization is at the cost of introducing a scale parameter S on the right-hand side of equations (SYS.3), (SYS.6) and (SYS.7), which is equivalent to redefining an aggregate value added function whose steady state version is $\\hat{\\mathrm{Y}}^{\\mathrm{ss}}=(1 / \\mathrm{n}) \\mathrm{S}\\left(\\hat{\\mathrm{K}}^{\\mathrm{ss}} / \\eta^{\\mathrm{ss}}\\right)^{\\mathrm{w}}\\left(\\mathrm{H}^{\\mathrm{ss}}\\right)^{\\mathrm{w}-\\mathrm{n}}$. Set $\\mathrm{S}=3.58$. Further, the steady states of the marginal product of capital, $\\mathrm{r}^{\\mathrm{ss}}$, and labor, $\\mathrm{w}^{\\mathrm{ss}}$, can be obtained from (SYS.6) and (SYS.7) after including the scale parameter $S$ and noting that $\\left(\\frac{\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}}{1+\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\left(1+\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}\\right)^{\\mathrm{n}}-1}\\right) \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{\\mathrm{n}}$ as $\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}} \\rightarrow 0$.\n\nThe remaining parameters are estimated using equation (SYS.5). Set $\\eta_{\\mathrm{H}}=0.066$, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{I}}=0.223$ and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Y}}=0.059$, depending on the growth model being considered. Table 2 summarizes the exact values selected for each of the model parameters following the described parameterization strategy as well as the associated steady state, henceforth referred to as baseline or initial steady state. By construction, both parameter values and the initial steady state are assumed to reflect, whenever possible, features of the economy prior to the introduction of a transaction tax $\\left(\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}=0\\right)$, including the pre-existing tax structure.\n\n# B. Solution Method \n\nThe computation of perfect foresight equilibrium paths of economic variables in our dynamic general equilibrium model is a difficult task because current and future variables are linked and endogenously determined, generating an infinite-dimensional system of nonlinear equations.\n\nTo reduce the complexity of the problem, by converting it into a finite-dimensional one, a solution method that exploits the structure of the economy to truncate the domain of the system is used. The solution method employed is somewhat related to Cooley and Hansen's (1992). This particular solution method seems appropriate given the scope of the paper. The experiments in the next section are aimed at assessing the effect of various",
      "16": "tax reforms on resource allocation. To evaluate these responses, transition paths of the economy from the initial steady state (given in Table 2) to final steady states characterized by alternative tax structures are required.\n\nThe solution algorithm is as follows. In the first step, the system (SYS) is linearized around the final steady state and solved for the recursive equilibrium law of motion and decision rules using the generalized Schur form or QZ decomposition of a matrix pencil following Klein's (2000) method. In the second step, it is assumed that T periods after having introduced a tax reform, the economy is in the neighborhood of the final steady state. As a result, from that moment on the motion of the economy is properly described by linear rules. Using $\\hat{\\mathrm{K}}_{0}=\\hat{\\mathrm{K}}^{\\text {ss }}$ as an initial condition and the linear decision rules (for $\\hat{\\mathrm{C}}_{\\mathrm{T}}, \\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{T}}$ ) as terminal or transversality conditions, the transition path of the economy from $\\mathrm{t}=1$ to $\\mathrm{t}=\\mathrm{T}$ can be computed by solving a finite but possibly large nonlinear system of equations\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{g}\\left(\\hat{\\mathrm{~K}}_{t-1}, \\hat{\\mathrm{~K}}_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\hat{\\mathrm{C}}_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\hat{\\mathrm{C}}_{\\mathrm{t}+1}, \\hat{\\mathrm{I}}_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{w}_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\mathrm{r}_{\\mathrm{t}+1}, \\eta_{\\mathrm{t}}, \\eta_{\\mathrm{t}+1} \\mid \\mathrm{n}, \\tau^{\\mathrm{C}}, \\tau^{\\mathrm{W}}, \\tau^{\\mathrm{K}}, \\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}\\right)=0, \\quad \\mathrm{t}=1, \\ldots, \\mathrm{~T}\n$$\n\nAfter period T, equilibrium paths are computed with the help of the law of motion and decision rules. Assume $\\mathrm{T}=100$.\n\n# C. Welfare Cost of a Tax Reform \n\nUnder the benchmark parameterization and corresponding initial steady state, if the baseline tax structure $\\left(\\tau^{\\mathrm{C}}, \\tau^{\\mathrm{W}}, \\tau^{\\mathrm{K}}, \\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}\\right)=(7.7 \\%, 14.8 \\%, 5.6 \\%, 0 \\%)$ remains unchanged, it can be shown that the steady state level of welfare equals ${ }^{4}$\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{W}^{\\mathrm{ss}}=\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\beta}\\right)\\left(\\theta \\ln \\hat{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\mathrm{ss}}+(1-\\theta) \\ln \\left(1-\\mathrm{H}^{\\mathrm{ss}}\\right)+\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta} \\theta \\ln \\eta^{\\mathrm{ss}}\\right)\n$$\n\nThis is the reference value against which the welfare cost of alternative tax reforms will be assessed.

The appropriately adjusted sum over 2000 periods only yields the same total. In deriving this expression, it is assumed, without loss of generality, that $Z_{1}=1$.",
      "17": "introduced in year $\\mathrm{t}=1$ and kept constant thereafter. $\\lambda \\cdot \\hat{\\mathrm{Y}}_{\\mathrm{t}}^{\\dagger}$ is interpreted as a consumption gift, as a compensation, in terms of consumption, required to make the household as well off under the alternative regime $\\tau$ as under the baseline tax structure. The consumption compensation is rescaled and expressed as percentage of distorted output (distorted under the new regime), as $\\lambda$.\n\n# 4. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND SIMULATION RESULTS \n\nExperiment 1. Kirilenko and Summers (2003) report on the productivity of banking transaction taxes in various Latin American countries in effect since 1989. Excluding Ecuador, where the transaction tax was originally intended to replace income taxes and, for that reason, debit and credit transactions were both taxed and the statutory rate as well as the amount of revenue collected were atypically large, the yield of the tax has not surpassed $1.6 \\%$ of GDP in the region. In Brazil, revenues are in the range of $0.80 \\%$ to $1.45 \\%$ of GDP. The first experiment conducted in this section evaluates growth and welfare effects of a reform of the baseline tax structure directed at raising additional revenue for a comparable amount - say equal to $2 \\%$ of GDP under the steady state of an alternative regime - changing one tax instrument at a time. Notice that in the final steady state the total tax revenue, as a percent of GDP, amounts to: $2 \\%+\\mathrm{KRO}+\\mathrm{CRO}+\\mathrm{WRO}=17.49 \\%$ for all model economies. Results are reported in Table 3.\n\nPanel A of Table 3 shows long-term welfare costs obtained from comparing allocations in the final and initial steady states. ${ }^{5}$ Panel B reports welfare costs computed along a path of 2000 periods in the transition from initial to final steady states. Costs along the transitional path are lower than steady state costs because along the way toward the new steady state, households adjusts consumption and leisure plans upwards, hence ameliorating welfare costs, in order to deliver lower capital stock, consumption and work effort for the new long-term growth path as a consequence of higher taxation. The exception is the economy with Romer's (1986) growth engine where transitional and steady state costs are identical. This result simply reflects the fact that that model has no transitional dynamics. Right after a tax reform is introduced, the economy converges to its new balanced growth path. As in Ortigueira's (1998) model, an implausibly large rate of convergence like this one renders unrealistically high growth and welfare costs of taxation. Finally, long-term rates of growth under alternative tax regimes are reported in the last panel.\n\nIndependently of the mechanism engendering endogenous growth, the cheapest way to raise the required revenue, not only in terms of welfare costs but also in terms of forgone\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ In this case $\\lambda$ solves the following equation:\n\n    $$\n    \\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\beta}\\right)\\left(\\theta \\ln \\left(\\hat{\\mathrm{C}}^{\\dagger}+\\lambda \\hat{\\mathrm{Y}}^{\\dagger}\\right)+(1-\\theta) \\ln \\left(1-\\mathrm{H}^{\\dagger}\\right)+\\frac{\\beta}{1-\\beta} \\theta \\ln \\eta^{\\dagger}\\right)=\\mathrm{W}^{\\prime \\prime \\prime}\n    $$",
      "18": "growth, is to use a consumption tax. For instance, the welfare cost of raising additional revenue equal to $2 \\%$ of GDP (and rebated back - along with the rest of tax revenue - to households as a lump-sum transfer) is $0.83 \\%$ of GDP when transitional dynamics are ignored and when growth is driven by work experience. This cost falls to $0.67 \\%$ of GDP if the transition is taken into account. The effect on the endogenous long-term growth rate is negligible. It falls 4 basis points, from $2.22 \\%$ in the benchmark steady state to $2.18 \\%$ under the new tax structure. The exact opposite, the most expensive instrument for raising additional revenue, is a tax on capital income, except in the transitional dynamics of an economy with a work experience externality driving the human capital accumulation process, where a labor income tax turns out to be more damaging.\n\nIn contrast to claims that theory and empirical evidence amply substantiate its highly distortionary status, Table 3 shows that a transaction tax imposes an intermediate level of distortions. In some cases, it is the best option after a consumption tax since it causes lower welfare costs than a labor income tax, as in the transitional paths of model economies with human capital technologies driven by work and production experience externalities. Interestingly, in all model specifications, the growth toll of a transaction tax is small, even comparable to that of a consumption tax.\n\nTo present a broader perspective, the same type of information - welfare costs and growth losses - is summarized in Figure 3 where targets for additional government revenue fluctuate between $1 \\%$ and $10 \\%$ of GDP. The figure shows that the relative ordering of taxes according to their distortionary capabilities does not generally change when revenue requirements are different from $2 \\%$ of GDP. Relative to the ordering offered by Table 3, only one ordering change is uncovered in Figure 3. When additional revenue requirements are low ( $2 \\%$ of GDP for instance) the model with a work experience externality shows that a tax on capital earnings is less distortionary than a TT along the transition path. However, with higher revenue requirements, transaction taxation becomes relatively less distortionary.\n\nRegarding growth effects, results in Figure 3 lend support to Harberger's (1964) superneutrality conjecture (see also Mendoza et al., 1997) according to which, tax reforms around the current tax structure have small or negligible effects on long-term growth. Harberger argues that fiscal policy is superneutral in the sense that this type of reform cannot increase (reduce) the economy's rate of growth more than 0.1 or 0.2 of a percentage point. This conclusion is consistent with Figure 3. Let us look at an extreme case. According to Figure 3, the highest growth sacrifice (difference between initial and final steady state growth rates) is produced by capital income taxation in an economy with human capital accumulation driven by an investment experience externality. If, in this model economy, the baseline capital earnings tax rate increases by 10 percentage points ${ }^{6}$ (from $5.57 \\%$ to $15.57 \\%$ ), tax revenues increase by $2.27 \\%$ of GDP and the longterm growth rate falls by only 0.23 of a percentage point - from $2.22 \\%$ to $1.99 \\%$ - very close to Harberger's figures. Reported results show that transaction taxation is not an\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ Mendoza et al. (1997) use reforms of a similar magnitude to assess Harberger's superneutrality conjecture.",
      "19": "exception to Harberger's superneutrality conjecture. In all model specifications, similar amounts of additional revenue raised with a transaction tax induce very small effects on growth.\n\nExperiment 2. The benefits of giving up taxing transactions as recommended by Tanzi (2000), IMF (2000) and Coelho et al. (2001) are assessed in Experiment 2. This experiment also sheds light on the empirical backing which justifies the popular policy advice to speedily abandon this tax - the claim that the longer the life span of transaction taxation is, the higher its costs will be (see Tanzi, 2000; Coelho et al., 2001; Kirilenko and Summers, 2003).\n\nCurrent well-known fiscal solvency concerns preclude user countries from simply renouncing much needed revenue. In consequence, a sensible policy experiment is to replace TT revenue with other sources. To that end, a two-step tax reform is designed. In period $\\mathrm{t}=1$ the baseline tax structure is reformed by introducing a transaction tax that generates additional revenue equal to $2 \\%$ of GDP under the new steady state. Then, in period $\\mathrm{t}=10$, which roughly corresponds to the current life span of the Brazilian transaction tax, the government pushes through a new reform which scrapes transaction taxation and increases existing rates on consumption, labor income or capital earnings taxes (one tax at a time) aimed at raising the required additional revenue under the newer steady state.\n\nThere are two possible approaches to modeling this nonstationary policy in our perfect foresight environment. First, though agents are endowed with perfect foresight, the government announces an unanticipated two-step reform at the beginning of period $t=1$. From then on, agents are fully aware of the trajectory of the tax system and temporariness of transaction taxation. The announcement of future policy changes (those planned for year $\\mathrm{t}=10$ ) does not give rise to credibility concerns. This case is referred to hereafter as the \"one shot case.\" The second approach is the following. At the beginning of period $\\mathrm{t}=1$ the government passes an unanticipated reform introducing a transaction tax which is expected to stay forever. A few years later, at the beginning of period $\\mathrm{t}=10$, the government again surprises everyone by abandoning transaction taxation and replacing its proceeds with revenue from other tax instruments. This case is referred to as the \"twoshot case\" and comes closer to the set-up related to embracing current policy recommendations.\n\nBased on a model economy with a work experience externality engendering endogenous growth and where a consumption tax is brought on as substitute for transaction taxation in period $t=10$, the transition paths of capital stock, investment, work effort, consumption, rate of growth, wage, marginal product of capital and output are depicted in Figure 4 under the two alternative approaches to modeling the specified two-step tax reform. As a point of reference, the figure also plots (dotted lines) transition paths associated with a reform introducing, a permanent consumption tax from the beginning $(\\mathrm{t}=1)$, hence avoiding transaction taxation, which, according to the results in Experiment 1, is the cheapest way to raise the required additional revenue within the",
      "20": "class of one-step stationary reforms. As mentioned above, the welfare cost of this reference policy is $0.67 \\%$ of GDP (Table 3, panel B). Is there still room for transaction taxation given that consumption taxation is less costly?\n\nWhen the two-step tax reform is implemented in one shot (first column of Figure 4), the economy, relative to the reference economy, exhibits higher capital and work effort and, as a result, higher economic activity and growth. The welfare cost of using transaction taxation during 10 periods and then replacing it with a higher consumption tax rate, as expected from period $t=1$, is only $0.46 \\%$ of GDP. This implies that the positive effects of consumption and growth on welfare outweigh the negative effect of reduced leisure along the transition path. When transaction taxation is scrapped unexpectedly, i.e., when the two-step reform is implemented in two shots (second column of Figure 4), the behavior of the economy is very different. Relative to the reference case, the economy enjoys higher leisure, which is good for current welfare but bad for growth, and capital and output are lower. The welfare cost of this policy is $0.74 \\%$ of GDP. The abandonment policy then brings some welfare gains since maintaining a transaction tax forever costs $0.85 \\%$ of GDP (Table 3, panel B).\n\nTo assess the robustness of these results, further experiments were conducted using alternative tax revenue substitutes, endogenous growth models and transaction taxation life spans (from 0 to 20 years). The corresponding welfare costs are shown in Figure 5. In each plot there are two horizontal lines. The upper one measures the cost of using solely transaction taxation to raise the required additional revenue from the start $(\\mathrm{t}=1)$ while the lower one measures the cost of using consumption taxation instead. The remaining lines show the welfare costs of temporarily using a transaction tax and, at some point (from 0 to 20 years), switching to an increased consumption, labor income and capital income tax. In the case of two-step reforms implemented in two shots (third column), it is important to notice that the transitional cost of using a TT depends on how TT revenues are restored. It is only in the case where these revenues are replaced with consumption tax revenues that we can be certain that a scrapping policy is welfare improving and that the benefit of the policy decreases with the duration of transaction taxation. However, when transaction taxation is replaced with a capital income tax, the scrapping policy generally worsens social welfare and, in that case, it is better to keep transaction taxation for as long as possible. In the case of labor income taxation, results are mixed and depend on the type of mechanism generating endogenous growth.\n\nThe welfare costs of two-step tax reforms implemented in one shot describe a Ushaped curve (something not observed in the short horizon of Figure 5, second column) as the duration of transaction taxation is prolonged. If a government can credibly commit itself to abandoning transaction taxation by a certain date in the future, even in the longterm future, for example, 20 years or so, a government financing policy that temporarily uses transaction taxation is less costly than one that finances the required additional revenue by resorting exclusively to a consumption tax. As a generalization, regardless of how TT revenue is replaced and regardless of the growth engine, the welfare cost of any financing policy that involves transaction taxation will eventually fall below the lower horizontal line (not completely shown in Figure 5 for all taxes) for quite a while. In",
      "21": "summary, for suitably long TT life spans, society will be better off temporarily using a transaction tax under nonstationary policies than under one-step stationary policies.\n\n# 5. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS \n\nAdditional robustness checks are conducted in this section. Information for Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Peru is given in Table 4 to experiment with other plausible parameter choices. Using information on TT rates and revenue collections, the calibrated number of production sectors for these countries is lower than the benchmark figure. Lower n, specifically $\\mathrm{n}=2$, is associated with only small changes in welfare costs and negligible growth effects.\n\nFurthermore, it has been shown that theory (equation in footnote 2) imposes a constraint relating $\\mathrm{n}, \\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}$ and the amount of revenue collected as a share of GDP. If it is deemed that there is no sizeable measurement error in tax collection ratios, theory helps us by pinning down a relationship between the other two less precisely measured magnitudes. All pairs $\\left(\\mathrm{n}, \\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}\\right)$ satisfying $\\left\\{\\left(\\mathrm{n}, \\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}\\right): \\mathrm{n}>1, \\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}>0\\right\\}$ as well as being consistent with a given TT collection ratio ( $1.45 \\%$ of GDP as in the baseline calibration) deliver exactly the same allocations in both experiments under consideration, and therefore, the same welfare and growth assessments. In this sense, results are robust under alternative, more complex, transaction structures. In other words, relative to the benchmark calibration, any higher n requires a lower $\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}$ to yield the same observed revenue ratio and their effects fully offset each other.\n\nThe relatively high level of taxation in Brazil is also underscored in Table 4. Brazilian tax ratios are cut in half in the next sensitivity test to approximate the aggregate tax burden observed in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru prior to the introduction of a TT. The effect of a lower preexisting tax burden is to reduce the welfare costs of raising additional revenue (equal to $2 \\%$ of GDP). The reduction is between $11 \\%$ and $14 \\%$ on average for consumption, capital income and transaction taxes and $24 \\%$ on average for a labor income tax (excluding the model with Romer's (1986) growth mechanism from the analysis). The effect on the long-term growth rate remains next to nil for all tax instruments and growth models. No major qualitative changes are revealed in transitional dynamics nor in the relative distortionary attributes of the tax instruments.\n\nNor are results sensitive to the time span assumed for an economy to come close to its new steady state after a tax reform is passed. The same results are obtained if $\\mathrm{T}=50$ years or $\\mathrm{T}=200$ is assumed.\n\n## 6. COMPARING RESULTS WITH THE LITERATURE\n\nAn effort is made in this section to \"square the circle\" by reconciling the differences between the results in this paper and the strikingly opposing conclusions drawn from the",
      "22": "existing literature. The existing empirical literature on bank debit taxation in Latin America is briefly reviewed in the following paragraphs.\n\nLozano and Ramos (2000) and Coelho et al. (2001) report anecdotal evidence on the allocational effects of a tax on financial transactions. They conjecture, and sometimes document, a myriad of potentially distortionary effects on activities such as foreign exchange, securities and interbank market transactions, the payment system operation, financial intermediation, monetary aggregates (currency outside banks), underground economy, etc. In addition, Koyama and Nakane (2001) provide econometric evidence for Brazil on the effect of a financial transaction tax on financial intermediation (number of written checks, M1, term deposits and bank intermediation spreads). Overall, this evidence vividly illustrates the point that a financial transaction tax is indeed distortionary. However, the quantitative question of how important these distortionary effects are is left unanswered. The policy recommendation that a bank debit tax should be sidestepped or soon replaced with superior taxes such as the VAT and income taxes (Coelho, et al., 2001) constitutes a non sequitur.\n\nInterpreting a tax on bank debits as an excise tax on financial intermediation, Albuquerque (2001a) and Kirilenko and Summers (2003) measure the deadweight welfare loss associated with this type of taxation using Harberger's triangle method. The former calculates a deadweight loss of $27 \\%$ of the revenue collected for Brazil while the latter computes deadweight losses of $30 \\%$ for Venezuela, $35 \\%$ for Colombia, $45 \\%$ for Ecuador and nil for Brazil. Though interesting, this evidence about the absolute level of distortions is not enough to dismiss bank debit taxation. With a different analytical approach (dynamic general equilibrium where tax proceeds are rebated back to households), the conclusions in this paper are based on much higher welfare losses. For the benchmark case of Brazil and when growth is driven by a work experience externality, the welfare cost of a transaction tax amounts to $43 \\%(0.85 \\% / 2 \\%)$ of the revenue collected. It comes to $86 \\%(1.71 \\% / 2 \\%), 49 \\%(0.97 \\% / 2 \\%)$ and $306 \\%(6.12 / 2 \\%)$ of collected revenue depending on whether the growth engine is an investment externality, a production externality or Romer's (1986) mechanism.\n\nAlbuquerque (2001b) develops a dynamic general equilibrium framework to study the economic effects of a tax on bank debits in Brazil. ${ }^{7}$ Unfortunately, instead of using the model to derive quantitative implications, the author estimates an ad hoc regression of the revenue productivity, defined as the revenue to GDP ratio divided by the TT rate, against the statutory TT rate. He, then, computes welfare triangles as in Albuquerque (2001a).\n\nFinally, it is interesting to compare the relationship between the TT revenue as a share of GDP and the TT rate obtained for Brazil using Albuquerque's (2001a, b) econometric estimates ${ }^{8}$ and the same relationship derived from the theoretical model of section 2\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ For completeness, Arbeláez et al. (2002) wrongly claim that their appraisal of the bank debit tax in Colombia is based on a general equilibrium model. They offer simple back-of-the-envelope calculations showing an obvious feature: that the nominal rate of a bank debit tax, akin to a turnover tax, may pyramid. But no evidence is offered showing that this has been the case.\n    ${ }^{8}$ Using Albuquerque's estimates the relation is given by",
      "23": "(equation in footnote 2, for $\\mathrm{n}=5$ and $\\mathrm{n}=7$ ). According to Figure 6 the behavior of the observed Brazilian TT collection closely corresponds to what theory predicts. If Albuquerque's partial equilibrium approach had been pursued in this paper, roughly the same welfare losses would have been obtained. ${ }^{9}$\n\nIn summary, though theory has argued that a non-neutral tax may be potentially highly distortionary, the existing empirical evidence has been unable to substantiate that claim.\n\n# 7. SUMMARY AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS \n\nDespite the attractiveness and popularity of views claiming that a bank debit tax as a means of collecting government revenue is very costly for society, thus far empirical work has failed to provide support for that conjecture. The question is tackled in this paper by developing a multisector dynamic general equilibrium model that allows for the pyramidation of the nominal tax rate, the major drawback of a non-neutral tax. The model is used to examine the efficiency implications of a bank debit tax, understood here as a general transaction tax, from a quantitative standpoint; or equivalently, it is assumed that all transactions in the economy are channeled through the banking system and there subject to a bank debit tax. An important aspect of the model is that conventional (consumption, labor income and capital income) taxes can be evaluated and compared with non-neutral taxes on an equal footing.\n\nThe findings in this paper manifestly contrast with the existing literature. The results suggest that a transaction tax is not an especially distortionary tax. It introduces lower distortions than a capital earnings tax and, in some cases, depending on the growth engine, lower than a labor income tax. The model shows that a consumption tax is clearly the least distorting instrument. Though a fiscal policy that chooses a consumption tax instead of a transaction tax to raise the required additional revenue will reap the rewards of relatively large efficiency gains, no improvement in the rate of economic growth should be expected. So, the question is whether there is still room for transaction taxation when governments can use a consumption tax, which is the \"(...) premier indirect tax from a technical point of view\" (Harberger, 1990), instead. This study demonstrates that a government financing policy that temporarily uses transaction taxation and subsequently replaces it with an alternative conventional tax is superior in terms of welfare to any other financing policy that avoids transaction taxation and resorts to a conventional tax to raise the required revenue from the outset. This result depends on the government announcing the two-step tax reform from the outset and credibly committing to it. Finally, the benefits of scrapping transaction taxation as recommended by many analysts are assessed in the paper. The fact that the benefit of the policy hinges on how TT revenue is replaced is also shown. It is only in the case where these revenues are\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\text { Revenue }}{\\text { GDP }}=5.04 \\cdot \\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}-345 \\cdot\\left(\\tau^{\\mathrm{T}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ The reason is that deadweight losses depend on the slope of the depicted relation. Notice that intercepts are zero.",
      "24": "replaced with consumption tax revenues that the TT scrapping policy is welfare improving and where the delay in implementing such a recommendation is costly for society. If the substitute is a capital income tax, the scrapping policy worsens social welfare and, in that case, it is better to keep transaction taxation for as long as possible.\n\nExtending the model to relax some of the assumptions made to obtain a tractable framework seems an interesting avenue for future research. Alternative transaction and production structures, with the number of sectors being determined endogenously in response to incentives to economize on transactions through vertical integration, should throw further light on our understanding of transaction taxation.",

      "1": "# Abstract \n\nDespite the growing body of literature examining the effectiveness of transparency and accountability initiatives, there remains limited substantiation for whether and how open budgeting contributes to reductions in poverty and improvements in the lives of the poor. This paper reviews available evidence and conclude that institutional changes can contribute to higher-level outcomes in certain contexts. The approach first draws from existing studies of transparency and accountability initiatives and then follows their references to broaden the evidence base. The findings highlight the importance of measuring budget transparency, accountability, and participation and tracing their outcomes along an incremental, nonlinear results chain. Logical links or ongoing loops in this sequence include the interplay\nor interdependency among these three dimensions; the subsequent achievement of key, often mutually reinforcing, intermediate development outcomes; and ultimately, improved program or service delivery as the key lever for influencing development impact. Rather than establishing standard indicators, the process begins to identify which aspects of the institutional change are valid for measurement and what contextual factors to consider. Overall, this review serves as a starting point and underscores the need for further investigation to establish effective measurement practices of institutional change and build an evidence base for understanding the relative robustness of institutional change paths and the context in which they are likely to matter.\n\nThis paper is a product of the Capacity Development and Results, World Bank Institute .

      "3": "# 1. Introduction \n\nThis report explores the critical question of \"What is the poverty impact of the Bank's development efforts?\" faced by all Bank programs in this era focused on achieving key poverty targets. Previously, in order to demonstrate results, it was enough to measure project outcomes and show how they met project development objectives. President Kim has raised the bar not only to demonstrate program outcomes, but to show how they contribute to overall poverty reduction. While this is challenging enough for standard infrastructure projects for which tangible outcomes exist and are easily measured, this task is even more difficult for institution building and capacity development initiatives for which the outcomes are intangible. Hence, the question we seek to answer in particular for the World Bank Institute (WBI) is \"What is the development impact of the institutional changes targeted by WBI?\"\n\nAnswering these questions is important both for accountability purposes and for better understanding our practices and the conditions under which they are most effective. First, we have to be able to answer to the Board, our donor partners and clients that what WBI is doing or seeking to achieve is important for improving the lives of the poor. In other words, it is important to determine whether or not we are doing the right things i.e., are the institutional changes we are targeting the right ones that actually influence development impact? Second, under what conditions are these institutional changes most effective in achieving human development outcomes?\n\nWBI has focused its efforts to innovate and experiment with various instruments and techniques to empower, influence and change institutions yet the impact of these institutions to actually help the marginalized and the poorest of the poor is difficult to prove with hard evidence. Further, it has yet to establish when and how these instruments are most effective. Thus, a review of the existing evidence is in order to determine whether and when institutions contribute to improved development outcomes and have an impact on poverty reduction.\n\nA cursory review of the literature and systematic reviews exploring poverty impact revealed not only the breadth of this topic, but also that these investigations' conclusions tend to be at a general level, reporting whether interventions were successful in meeting stated objectives but not in terms of detailing what worked and what did not work during implementation (Santibanez 2013, Fennell, van Gevelt, and Safdar 2013).\n\nThe methods used in standard program evaluations and rigorous impact evaluations with experimental designs and randomized control trials (RCTs) control for a number of key factors that are actually critical to understanding how future interventions could be better implemented, replicated or scaled up. Thus, the necessary information for discovering the science of delivery is missing. This paper, therefore, seeks to unpack the question of when and how there is institutional impact on poverty reduction by focusing on a WBI practice area that is also highly relevant for the Bank - i.e., open budgeting in the field of public financial management.",
      "4": "# 1.1 Objectives \n\nIn this paper, we explore the key question of whether there is evidence linking open budgeting to high level development outcomes that reflect improvements in the lives of the poor. For the purposes of this investigation, we follow the conventional way poverty reduction is typically operationalized in the area of open budgeting and public financial management that is, as improved access to better quality public services for the poor. We explicitly do not focus on macroeconomic benefits nor include any empirical literature about the relationship between fiscal transparency and growth in this review.\n\nWe identify and piece together evidence demonstrating the development impact of Open Budgeting by conducting a review of the available literature. We examine evidence supporting and refuting various small incremental steps in a results chain to establish linkages between open budgeting and improved human development outcomes and improvements in public services. This approach first draws from existing studies of transparency and accountability initiatives and then follows their references to broaden the evidence base. The review is not exhaustive but is instead intended to highlight findings for further investigation and discussion.\n\nThe second key question we explore is whether or not we can identify \"leading indicators of institutional change impact.\" These are concrete observable milestones marking points of progress in open budgeting interventions that eventually contribute to development outcomes for the poor.\n\nIn this paper, we start with the overall goal of poverty reduction and unpack it as improvements for the poor in the delivery of basic public services such as health, water, sanitation, roads and transport. We then look to see whether studies identified indicators of institutional changes that affect the success of various open budgeting interventions and if so how they were defined. Unpacking how changes in institutional conditions influenced development outcomes through observable leading indicators would provide insights on which institutions to target and how.\n\n### 1.2 Institutional changes: Transparency, accountability and participation\n\nWe explore this by considering three key institutional changes and how they affect poverty: fiscal transparency, accountability, and participation. Fiscal transparency refers to the public disclosure of fiscal information related to the budget process (OECD 2002). This includes publication of information in a timely and systematic manner. Accountability refers to \"answerability,\" in terms of the need for government leaders to provide information and justify their actions and \"enforceability,\" reflecting potential negative consequences when the answerability falls short (McGee and Gaventa 2011).\n\nAccountability can include procedures for public hearings and investigations, public audits, and transparency institutions and independent judiciaries. Participation is about citizens participating in the budget decision making monitoring and audit process and how and when public funds are spent. Participatory budgeting (PB) can happen through direct citizen involvement in voting for",
      "5": "budget allocations, for instance, or through delegation to a council or elected PB leader who represents the citizenry in the budget decision-making process.\n\nThe three are often interrelated and mutually reinforcing. In other words, some argue that transparency is necessary for accountability because without information, citizens could not hold their governments accountable (de Renzio, Guardian newspaper). In addition, participatory budgeting increases fiscal transparency that thereby improves accountability of local officials to deliver better public services (Baiocchi, Heller, Chaudhuri and Silva 2006).\n\nHowever, it has also been argued that holding governments accountable is what makes governments comply with transparency, and that participation encourages accountability (Wampler 2004, Ackerman 2003). Given the complex nature of the relationships between these institutional changes, we examine each of them in the following as both unique concepts and other times as part of endogenous interactions.\n\nOverall, the normative expectation is that these institutional changes will lead to better development results. That is, budgets will better meet the needs of the citizenry and the poor will be better represented and served by including the citizenry. This paper will present evidence supporting and refuting this as well as some more textured findings about the conditions under which these institutional changes are likely to be more or less effective in varying contexts. In addition, within each of the following sections on transparency, accountability and participation, we present the indicators used to measure development outcomes and institutional level changes when available in the studies.\n\n# 2. Fiscal Transparency \n\nThe process of identifying any causal chains to which transparency contributes should start with a definition of what such transparency includes. The OECD's Best Practices for Budget Transparency (2002) defines this term quite simply as \"the full disclosure of all relevant fiscal information in a timely and systematic manner.\" Robinson (2006) highlighted two dimensions of transparency that are particularly relevant to the budget process. The first relates to the mandate for the executive to \"divulge the sources of data and information used to frame decisions\" and second focuses on the transparency of the budget process in the public domain including the basis on which priorities are formulated and the distribution of roles and responsibilities (p.12).\n\nEvidence is emerging that transparency can contribute to key intermediate development outcomes under the right conditions. Identifying these outcomes and their accompanying factors is critical for understanding whether and how budget transparency matters for any efforts to reduce poverty and improve human development indicators over the longer term. As McGee and Gaventa noted in their broad literature review of transparency and accountability initiatives, \"many initiatives are not underpinned by a clear articulation of exactly what outcome or impact is sought, or of how the actions and inputs contemplated are expected to generate that outcome or impact\" (2011 p.15). The exploration of evidence and assumptions for every stage of the results chain, including the more immediate incremental changes, is needed to define the causal sequence and identify high priority contextual variables.",
      "6": "# 2.1 The effects of transparency related to good governance and institutional quality \n\nOne potential benefit of transparency is the improved accountability of government. The general public, civil society, media, and the legislature are better positioned to hold the executive to account when they have sufficient information on the allocation and use of public resources. Robinson (2006) reviewed the findings from six detailed case studies of independent budget work and noted \"transparency can help to reduce the scope for corruption through the misallocation of expenditures or the diversion of public resources for private ends.\" For example, in Mexico, Fundar's efforts to increase the transparency of the budget policies first led to new federal legislation to ensure public access to information and then to the establishment of a new review and enforcement agency to \"compel government departments to comply with the provisions of the legislation\" (p.26).\n\nHowever, transparency alone does not guarantee greater accountability. Joshi (2011, p.7) explored existing evidence of causal relationships between transparency and accountability and their impact and effectiveness in the service delivery arena and found that \"many initiatives are focused at increasing transparency and amplifying voice, without examining their link with accountability and ultimately responsiveness.\" Her review of several studies led to the conclusion that a key contextual factor is the \"willingness from the public sector to support attempts to improve accountability\" (p.19). The tenuousness of the connection between information accessibility and accountability is echoed in numerous other studies, underscoring the need for further investigation and analysis (McGee and Gaventa 2011; Bellver and Kaufmann 2005; Carlitz 2012).\n\nOverall, the evidence indicates that increased transparency can lead to better quality governance and reduced corruption under the right conditions. Islam (2003) explored the links between information flows and institutional quality and concluded that countries with better information flows govern better. Her analysis focused in particular on the existence of freedom of information laws and a constructed \"transparency\" index that measured the frequency with which economic data are published in countries around the world. Other studies further confirm an association between greater budget transparency, reduced corruption, and improved governance (Kaufmann and Bellver 2005; Hameed 2005).\n\n## Indicators\n\nThe measurements of transparency that were used to trace the effects related to good governance and institutional quality in the studies discussed above were generally based on a review of legislative records and/or the construction of a transparency index using available economic data:\n\n- Robinson (2006) identified the implementation of federal legislation to ensure public access to information $(\\mathrm{Y} / \\mathrm{N})$ and the creation of a review and enforcement agency to compel governments to comply with the provisions of legislation to ensure public access to information $(\\mathrm{Y} / \\mathrm{N})$.\n- Islam (2003) constructed a transparency index using 11 representative variables from four sectors (real, fiscal, financial and external) for a total of 169 countries.\n- Islam (2003) also used the passage of a freedom of information act to confirm a country's progress towards becoming more transparent.",
      "7": "# 2.2 The effects of transparency for enhanced budgets and more efficient spending \n\n## Increasing access to budget information can also enhance the resources available and\n\nimprove their allocation for more efficient spending. The experience of the Republic of Korea has been that enhancing budget transparency has \"facilitated the use of information by various stakeholders\" so that civil society organizations can influence budgetary priorities and National Assembly members could upgrade policy debates among other benefits (You and Lee 2011, pp.30-33). Robinson emphasized the importance of transparency from the perspective of equity and social justice, where secrecy \"can result in priorities that are biased towards elite interests and not tailored to the needs and priorities of the poor.\" The case studies he reviewed signaled a connection between budget transparency and increased allocations for social welfare expenditure priorities, especially for reproductive health in Mexico, child support grants in South Africa, and tribal development expenditures in Gujarat (pp.12-20).\n\nImproving the tracking of aid allocation and expenditures can contribute to better resource management in aid delivery. By analyzing data from 70 countries collected via a country-level survey on mutual accountability and transparency, Martin (2010) concluded that strengthening transparency resulting from the better tracking of aid information contributed to the better prioritization of spending needs for a pro-poor orientation and overall improvements in budgeting and spending related to aid delivery. Key factors reflecting improvements in transparency included the breadth of information available (i.e., to include projected future disbursements, compliance with national and international aid effectiveness targets, etc.) and the timeliness and consistency of information available from a range of sources.\n\n## Indicators\n\nReviews and studies to date have focused largely on qualitative data from case studies where the results logic is understood within a unique context. However, the analyses do demonstrate the types of indicators that can be used to measure needed changes in transparency that contribute to enhanced budgets and more efficient spending, such as in the following examples.\n\n- Use of a national mutual accountability and aid transparency survey (Martin 2006) to collect multi-stakeholder input from each country to assess the presence and quality of mechanisms for ensuring transparency, such as:\n- The existence of a national aid policy document defining the government's priorities on aid with formal provider targets\n- The use of forums in which providers and recipients discuss development results and aid issues\n- The inclusion of budget analyses from independent monitoring groups, parliaments, and civil society organizations\n- Use of Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys to identify budget leakages and publicize them for enhancing budget allocations to pro-poor priorities (Joshi 2010)\n- Level of inadequacy of existing allocations and discrepancies between commitments and actual disbursements based on independent budget analysis (Robinson 2006)",
      "8": "# 2.3 The effects of transparency on citizen participation in the budget process \n\nFiscal transparency can enhance participation by improving the quality of public debate and the contributions of citizens and CSOs to the policy-making, budgeting, monitoring and implementation process. Robinson (2006) concluded, based on the review of six case studies, that improving the amount and quality of budget information available could diversify the range of actors engaged in the deliberation of budget priorities. One notable example of the potential for this causal chain has been the experience of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which works to ensure that revenues accruing to governments from extractive sectors are well documented and publicly disclosed. Disclosing this budget information allows for greater scrutiny of how revenues are being used, provides a platform for public engagement, and fosters public debate (Eads and Krakenes 2010, Reite T. et al 2011).\n\nTransparency is a necessary but not always sufficient condition for fostering citizen engagement. In their review assessing the impact of transparency and accountability initiatives, McGee and Gaventa (2011) highlighted examples of how access to budget information is a key ingredient for participatory budgeting. Their findings included that freedom of information can contribute to improved public understanding and public participation (citing Hazell and Worthy 2009) and that the Right to Information campaign in India contributed to new legislation and mobilized stakeholders to use information to achieve development objectives (citing Jenkins 2007). However, Zhang (2012) reported on a pilot field experiment in Kenya exploring how an information campaign about politician spending could impact citizen engagement. In this case, local participation in the monitoring of public goods increased only when citizens received instructions about how to take action in addition to the information about the missing funds.\n\n### 2.4 Links between transparency and development impact\n\nThere is some evidence that budget transparency leads to stronger human development outcomes. Limited studies have been conducted to date that directly connect budget transparency to higher level development outcomes; however, the research by Fukuda-Parr, Guyer, and Lawson-Remer (2011) does demonstrate how indicators measuring transparency can be operationalized to analyze development effects. Recognizing the limited empirical evidence available on the impact of budget transparency, Fukuda-Parr et al, used a variety of techniques to analyze the relationship between budget transparency as measured by the Open Budget Index (OBI) and a range of indicators of development outcomes. Their findings were that the overall OBI is a significant predictor of child and infant health outcomes and access to improved drinking water, even when controlling for the effects of income and region. This analysis confirmed and elaborated on previous studies by Bellver and Kaufmann (2005) and Islam (2006) in which the researchers constructed their own indicators of transparency and identified positive relationships between transparency and development outcomes and governance characteristics (Fukuda-Parr et. al. 2011).\n\n## Indicators\n\nThe OBI is a compilation of rankings of budget transparency made by objective (nongovernment) country experts. Because the sub-indices in some cases correlated more strongly",
      "9": "with some development outcomes than the overall OBI did, the researchers explored the impact of some components of budget transparency separately. Specifically, a series of regression analyses explored whether associations between transparency and human development outcomes are significant when the impacts of different income levels and geography are taken into effect. The regime type and institutional quality indicators included:\n\n- Freedom House ${ }^{1}$ Civil Rights Index score\n- Freedom House Political Rights Index score\n- Open Budget Index score\n- Legislative strength index, based on subset of OBI questions\n- Supreme Audit institution strength index, based on subset of OBI questions\n- Citizen participation index, based on subset of OBI questions\n- Polity IV Regime Type ${ }^{2}$\n\n\n# 2.5 The factors or conditions needed for transparency to have the desired effect \n\nIn each case, assessing the quality of transparency or the presence of certain characteristics is required in order to identify associated outcomes. Numerous studies have suggested that transparency in budgeting does not always matter and does not guarantee progress toward development outcomes. For example, a broad systematic review of econometric and quantitative studies exploring the impact of changes in the transparency of infrastructure procurement and delivery found that increasing transparency did not contribute to the desired outcomes in more than half (53\\%) of the 862 observations (Annamalai et al 2012). McGee and Gaventa (2010) concluded that it is not yet possible to generalize the effects of factors for articulating a reliable results chain, but their review summarized two categories of factors that are likely to contribute to the effectiveness of transparency in contributing to intermediate and higher-level outcomes:\n\n- State responsiveness (supply) factors- that is, the level of democratization, political will, broader enabling legal frameworks, political incentives, and sanctions.\n- Citizen voice (demand) factors-such as the opportunities for citizens and CSOs to use budget information and participate in budgeting processes, and the degree to which transparency and accountability initiatives interact with other collective action strategies.\n\nTransparency leads to accountability only under certain conditions. Fox (2007) highlighted an important distinction between \"clear\" versus \"opaque\" transparency, where \"clear transparency sheds light on institutional behavior\" and \"permits interested parties (such as policy makers, opinion makers, and programme participants) to pursue strategies of constructive change\" (p.667). Transparency is more likely to produce the intended effects when it fulfills both the condition of \"publicity\"-having relevant disclosed information actually reach the intended audience-and the condition of \"political agency\"-having mechanisms where citizens can take action in response to the disclosed information (Peixoto 2013).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Freedom House is an independent watchdog organization dedicated to the expansion of freedom around the world and collects data on various related issues (among other activities).\n    ${ }^{2}$ The Polity IV Project continues the Polity research tradition of coding the authority characteristics of states in the world system for purposes of comparative quantitative analysis.",
      "10": "The effectiveness of independent budget groups in using information varies according to circumstances. In his review of case studies, Robinson (2006) concluded that independent budget groups could play a positive role to facilitate development outcomes when certain explanatory factors are in place. Any analysis must also therefore consider the strength and flexibility of broader alliances in civil society, the quality of relationships established with government and the legislature to share information, the quality of legislative engagement in budget deliberation and review and the flexibility of the budget process. The independent budget groups themselves must acquire legitimacy for their work by producing timely, accurate and accessible data.\n\n# 3. Accountability \n\nAccountability, often interrelated with transparency, is an important end in itself. While there are varying definitions of accountability, there is broad agreement that the term ideally refers both to \"answerability\" in terms of the need to provide information and justify one's actions and \"enforceability\" reflecting possible penalties or consequences when the answerability falls short (McGee and Gaventa 2011). Common definitions refer to \"horizontal\" accountability as that relating to various mechanisms or institutions providing checks and balances among the branches of the state and \"vertical\" accountability referring to that between citizens and the state (Carlitz 2010; Robinson 2006). There has also been growing focus on \"societal accountability\" mechanisms of a hybrid form, termed \"diagonal accountability,\" which blur the separation between the state and society (Ackerman 2004).\n\n### 3.1 Accountability can enhance budgets and contribute to better service delivery\n\nHolding duty bearers accountable for spending commitments can lead to an enhanced budget for supporting the needed infrastructure development and pro-poor services. Malajovich and Robinson (2006) examined the case of Developing Initiatives for Social and Human Interaction (DISHA) in Gujarat, India in which DISHA informs elected local councilors of specific allocations under the state budget for infrastructure development and checks whether implementation is under way. If the local official was found to be unaware of the allocation, DISHA places pressure on the local administration to ensure that funds are used for their designated purpose. Similarly, the Uganda Debt Network (UDN) relied on community monitors to report the misuse of budget resources to local authorities so that resources allocations could be reassigned in line with the budget provisions (Robinson 2006, Renzio et al. 2006). This misuse was identified by noting such problems as the lack of conformity with technical specifications in the building of classrooms, the absence of teachers, and the lack of essential drugs in health facilities.\n\nCommunity monitoring has been shown to improve the quality of services. Notable cases have included communities engaging with local health services in Uganda to monitor providers and improve the responsiveness of service delivery and teachers increasing their attendance rates in India in response to improved incentives and accountability mechanisms (Carlitz 2010, Duflo et al 2012, Bjorkman and Svensson 2009). The literature has indicated promising effects of accountability initiatives but also underscored the need for caution in interpreting these findings, particularly given the weaknesses of public satisfaction indicators for assessing service quality and the added value of using accountability mechanisms together with incentives and user engagement strategies (Deichmann and Lall 2007; Duflo et al 2012).",
      "11": "# Indicators \n\nThe exploration of accountability and its effects on service delivery have relied on qualitative methods in many cases to articulate results chains that have been achieved in those specific contexts. Examples of indicators and approaches for assessing accountability have included the following:\n\n- Accountability achieved (and strengthened) was assessed by DISHA through a review of government budget data errors and the number of timely errata statements issues (for accuracy of the budget) and by tracing the process of expenditure tracking wherein DISHA requests information on the progress of specific allocations and contacts Panchayats to find out if the funds were disbursed for the relevant purposes. This laborintensive expenditure tracking allowed DISHA to tally and report on \"under-spends\" committed by the government over time (Malajovich and Robinson 2006).\n- Quality of services was measured according to citizen assessments. Bjorkman and Svensson (2009) conducted a randomized field experiment on community-based monitoring of public primary health care providers in Uganda. The experiment covered 50 communities in nine districts. NGOs facilitated village and staff meetings in which members of the communities discussed baseline information on the status of health service delivery relative to other providers and the government standard. Community members were also encouraged to develop a plan identifying key problems and steps the providers should take to improve health service provision. The primary objective of the intervention was to initiate a process of community-based monitoring that was then up to the community to sustain and lead. Treatment practices, including immunization of children, waiting time, examination procedures, and absenteeism, improved significantly in the treatment communities.\n\n\n### 3.2 The effects of accountability for good governance and institutional quality\n\nAccountability can help to curb corruption. The UDN and DISHA examples help to demonstrate how community monitoring mechanisms make it more difficult for officials to divert budget resources for undesignated purposes. This is a common finding in the literature in terms of the value of holding stakeholders engaged in the budget process accountable. A range of mechanisms such as community scorecards, social audits, and various complaint mechanisms have been used effectively to ensure better that budgets are allocated and implemented as planned (Deininger and Mpuga 2005, Sing and Vutukuru 2020, Caseley 2003).\n\nSocial accountability can promote good governance. The interplay between transparency, accountability, and participation surfaces when citizens gain access to information that increases their disillusionment with the quality of governance and \"moves them beyond electoral participation\" (Gaventa and McGee 2013). Malena et al (2004) argue that social accountability mechanisms (e.g. mass mobilization, use of the courts, etc.) \"Allow ordinary citizens to access information, voice their needs, and demand accountability between elections.\" This \"more informed, organized and systematic manner\" of engaging bureaucrats increases the \"chances of effective positive change\" (p.5).",
      "12": "The specific role and value of participatory approaches for achieving accountability remains unclear. Olken (2007) used randomized controlled trial methodology to examine two different approaches to accountability and found that participatory mechanisms such as anonymous feedback forms or accountability meetings had negligible impact whereas the increase in government audits led to an 8 percent decrease in missing expenditures (cited in McGee and Gaventa, 2010). In contrast, other studies argue for the value of citizen monitoring and advocacy but use less rigorous approaches (Deininger and Mpuga 2005, Sing and Vutukuru 2020, Caseley 2003).\n\n# Indicators \n\nAccountability was measured using two approaches based on RCT (Olken 2007). The first focused on participatory monitoring methods, including counting the frequency of accountability meetings and the submission of anonymous feedback forms. The second counted the frequency of government audits in terms of the probability that a particular entity would be audited. The resulting effect on corruption in this case was assessed in terms of the amount of missing expenditures.\n\n### 3.3 The link between accountability and human development outcomes\n\nEmerging evidence suggests there is a link between accountability and higher-level human development outcomes. The analysis conducted by Fukuda-Parr et al (2011) on the relationship between the OBI and various development outcomes also included tests for various sub-indices constructed from specific subsets of questions in recognition that \"some aspects of budget transparency are more important for enabling positive development outcomes than others\" (p.18). For example, sub-indices were created for the strength of the legislative branch, supreme audit institution and citizen participation, and in some cases, these sub-indices were stronger predictors than the overall OBI score. The results showed that accountability, even when controlling for GDP per capita and region, was more strongly associated with health development outcomes than the OBI.\n\n## Indicators\n\n- Accountability was measured by the Supreme Audit Institution Strength Index (FukudaPar et al. 2011). This index reflects the straight average of country scores for a subset of questions in the Open Budget Survey.\n- Participation was measured by Fukuda-Par et al. (2011) through the Citizen Participation Index that reflects the straight average of country scores for a subset of questions in the Open Budget Survey about opportunities for citizens to participate in the budget process.\n\nStudies examining the outcomes of community monitoring for improved service delivery show some effects on improved human development outcomes over time. For example, the randomized field experiment conducted by Bjorkman and Svensson (2009) in Uganda for 50 communities showed positive effects related to the weight of infants receiving services by health providers and a marked decrease ( $33 \\%$ ) in under-5 mortality just one year after the first round of baseline community meetings.",
      "13": "# 4. Participation \n\nParticipatory budgeting refers to the devolution of decision-making authority and monitoring to local actors. Public participation in the budget process can take place at different stages of the cycle, including budget preparation, implementation and oversight. The purpose is to increase transparency, tap into local sources of information, improve accountability of elected officials and public service deliverers and encourage innovation. Participatory budgeting creates incentives for public involvement and strengthens civil society through an institutional mechanism that can contribute to building an empowered citizenry including the poor (Baiocchi, Heller, Chaudhuri and Silva 2006).\n\nParticipation by the community ranges from direct democracy to indirect delegate models. Direct democracy is where citizens are entitled to participate directly in neighborhood meetings to prioritize publically funded projects where each participant can vote and in some cases also be elected as a delegate or councilor. Conversely, in indirect democracy or community-based representative democracy, citizens' perspectives are carried out through delegate councils or leaders through social movements or neighborhood associations. Participation can take place through approving the budget or in some cases it has been argued, through simple consultations with citizens where the executive and legislative branches make the decisions. The decisionmaking bodies in participatory budgeting (PB) are often built on preexisting social and political frameworks such as neighborhood associations. Alternatively, they can be formed expressly for the purpose of PB through creating a PB council that establishes the decision making system, resource allocation criteria, when and how often plenary meetings will take place along with their agendas, and the finalized budget to present to the municipal councils.\n\nAccording to Cabannes' (2004) analysis of participatory budgeting based on 25 municipalities in Latin America and Europe, PB varies by population size, municipal resources, styles of participation (popular participation vs. local government), degree of consolidation of the experiences and amount of funds allocated to PB. Baiocchi, Heller, Chaudhuri and Silva define direct participation as citizens participating in open decision-making forums such as neighborhood assemblies, and delegative participation as new forms of representation through delegate councils.\n\n### 4.1 Influence of participation on citizen behavior\n\nThe logic behind the practice of participatory budgeting influencing citizen behavior is that participation in decision making makes people more likely to comply because they have a say in the process. Dal Bo, Foster and Putterman's (2010) experimental findings suggest that individuals are more cooperative and compliant when they are allowed to participate. The results showed that democratically selected policies had a greater impact than policies that were imposed in a non-democratic way. Participatory processes led to greater cooperation both in civic responsibilities (e.g., paying taxes) and in complying with policies related to people's work and livelihood (e.g., farmer cooperation with irrigation policies).\n\nParticipatory budgeting increased knowledge about taxes and public services and subsequently led to increased tax revenues. Innovations in budgeting that incorporated direct",
      "14": "participation by citizens and new budget processes and patterns of decision-making led to wider public involvement especially among poor citizens in Porto Alegre, Brazil. Lower income citizens understood that increases in taxes would mean increases in services and benefits for them as a result of participating in regional meetings (Schneider and Baquero 2006).\n\nSchneider and Baquero (2006) showed that participatory budgeting mobilized support for tax reforms among all citizens regardless of income level. The common determinant influencing satisfaction with tax contributions was confidence in participatory budgeting. Citizens who trusted in participatory budgeting were more satisfied with their tax contributions. The mediating factor distinguishing between the poor and middle class was perceived benefit. A perceived increase in non-material benefits (i.e., improved efficiency, reduced corruption) increased middle class satisfaction. On the other hand, an increase in material benefits (e.g., investment in social sectors) increased satisfaction by the lower class. Perceptions about what are the benefits of participatory budgeting also differed by income level. The middle class was more likely to link PB to democratic values and more transparent government whereas the lower class was more likely to associate PB with investments for poor and increased social assistance. However, all citizens perceived both material and non-material benefits from participatory budgeting. In short, citizens' positive perceptions of PB were associated with enhanced satisfaction with their tax contributions and thereby increased tax revenues.\n\nThese patterns were evident in a broader comparative analysis of 25 countries in Latin America and Europe that showed that PB led to increases in tax revenues and a decrease in delinquencies (Cabannes 2004). The immediate visibility of the work and services that resulted from PB changed citizens' views on taxes and their related habits. For example, the PB advisors reported, \"The community, on learning what the municipality's budgetary and financial situation is, becomes aware of its budgetary restrictions. Then, when there are not enough resources for the implementation of its projects, the community decides to collaborate with personnel, financial resources or materials, aiming not only at increasing the resources available for them, but at enlarging the infrastructure initially approved\" (p.36).\n\n# Indicators \n\n- Trust in participatory budgeting and perceived benefits were measured by survey responses (Cabannes 2004, Schneider and Baquero 2006).\n- Compliance and increases in revenue were measured by tax receipts (Cabannes 2004, Schneider and Baquero 2006)\n\nCitizens are more willing to pay taxes when they perceive that their preferences are taken into consideration by public institutions. Frey, Benz and Stutzer's (2004) review of the literature argues that procedural utility - individuals' preferences about how instrumental outcomes are generated - are a value to citizens' satisfaction along with the actual outcomes themselves (e.g., in taxation, wealth redistribution, and public good allocation). These arguments support research suggesting that if participatory budgeting makes citizens feel like they have a say in the priority-setting and that their voices are heard, they will be more satisfied with the outcomes even if they are not optimal.",
      "15": "Torgler and Schneider (2009) present evidence from around the world (59 countries) showing that if citizens perceive that their interests are properly represented in political institutions (institutional quality is high), the likelihood that they would avoid paying taxes and participate in the underground economy decreases. The other significant determinant is tax morale indicating citizens' beliefs in their moral obligation to pay taxes as a contribution to society. Likewise, Frey and Frey (2002) demonstrate that individuals experience higher utility when they perceive the taxation process as more respectful and are therefore more willing to pay their taxes.\n\n# Indicators \n\n- Institutional quality or perceptions that political institutions represent citizens' interest in the Torgler and Schneider 2009 study are measured using the \"Quality of Governance\" index which measures perceive quality of governance (Kaufman, Kraay, and Mastruzzi 2003). The key dimensions are: voice and accountability in terms of the political process, civil liberties and political rights; political stability and absence of violence such as perceptions about the stability of government; capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement policies including government effectiveness to produce policies and deliver goods, and regulatory quality indicating policy friendliness of environment to businesses; respect for citizens and the state for institutions that govern economic and social interactions including rule of law or the degree of agents' confidence in and compliance with rules of society and control of corruption or perceptions about the degree of corruption.\n- Shadow economy was measured in the Torgler and Schneider 2009 study as the deliberate concealment of market-based legal production of goods and services from public authorities including avoiding payment of: income, value added or other taxes, social security contribution, minimum wages and complying with safety standards and administrative procedures.\n- Tax morale is measured in the Torgler and Schneider 2009 study as an individual's belief in the moral obligation to pay taxes as a contribution to society\n\nCitizen participation in decision making and establishing laws and policies led to smoother project implementation. For instance, Bardhan's (2000) experiment shows that citizens' participation led to fewer hurdles in implementation of an agricultural irrigation project. He found that when average farmers believe they had a say in water rules, rather than the elite or government, they are more likely to be positive about the water allocation system and about rule compliance by other farmers. In fact, the farmers who were typically most guilty of violating the rules (elite) were more likely to follow the rules when they helped to establish them.\n\n### 4.2 The influence of participatory budgeting on government\n\nParticipatory budgeting can increase accountability by municipal governments that then improve openness and transparency. Participatory budgeting engages citizens and encourages their engagement beyond just sharing their opinions on the budget allocations and identifying projects most important for their communities. Through institutional mechanism of PB, citizens can hold government accountable for budget outcomes in a public forum that contributes to greater transparency.",
      "16": "Various qualitative case studies in Brazil, Mexico, the United States and India showed that PB improved decision-making and accountability (Wampler 2004, Ackerman 2003). Wampler's case studies showed that PB enhanced accountability in Porto Alegre and Reclife and also slightly transparency; however, outcomes from citizen participation on the policymaking process were limited because most of the decision-making power was in the mayor's office.\n\nPB was primarily effective through providing a mechanism for citizens to express their opinions and to confront government officials directly in public meetings, which translated into increased openness and transparency (Wampler 2004). ${ }^{3}$ Although the evidence to date confirming a relationship between the legal institutionalization of participative mechanisms and development outcomes remains limited, Ackerman (2003) also concluded that it is necessary to formally institutionalize participatory procedures in order for PB to work properly.\n\n# Indicators \n\nThe case studies included only vague qualitative descriptions of what can be interpreted as indicators.\n\n- For instance, indicators of development outcomes included the implementation of public works.\n- Likewise, indicators of improvements in vertical accountability were simply described as citizens playing a larger role in decision making through engaging in meaningful deliberation and negotiation thereby reducing the role of municipal governments.\n- Similarly, increased transparency was defined as governments making more information available.\n\nCitizen participation in the budget process can enhance budgets for service delivery and infrastructure for the poor and implementation capacity. Various studies suggest that participatory budgeting leads to better accountability; lower levels of corruption; improvement in public service delivery; reversion of priorities to pro-poor policies; more social justice redistribution in allocation of resources; efficiency gains and more rational administration (Souza 2001, Navarro 2001, Ackerman 2003, Cabannes 2004, World Bank 2004, You and Lee 2013).\n\nPB has been associated with improving the legitimacy of decision-making processes; monitoring of citizen feedback on public policies and services; communication between citizens and government officials; and better understanding of public demand (Martin and Sanderson 1999, Lerner and Wagner 2006, Donnelly-Roark et al. 2001). In addition, it has been shown to improve the capacity of government to allocate funds across divisions to implement planned projects. For example, in the case of Brazil, the PB process produced a budget that included more accurate estimates of receipts and the state spent an amount that was closer to planned expenses (Schneider and Goldfrank 2002).\n\n## Indicators:\n\n- Efficiency was defined as whether the PB process allocated sufficient funds across organizations to implement planned projects (Schneider and Goldfrank 2002).\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ On the other hand, PB did not have a direct effect on accountability in Sao Paulo due to the administration's lack of support.",
      "17": "- $\\boldsymbol{P B}$ was measured as the percentage of the electorate that participated in the PB process the year before designing the budget (Schneider and Goldfrank 2002).\n\nParticipatory budgeting can improve public management and public service delivery. For instance, a comparison of participatory budgeting at the county level in Brazil showed that on average, counties where participatory budgeting policies have been implemented are better managed, have lower levels of corruption, and fewer irregularities than socio-economically similar counties without participatory budgeting (Zamboni 2007). This comparison was based on ten counties with PB and ten counties without PB. The counties were matched on variables that influence governance such as voter turnout, the presence of the seat of a judiciary district as well as the number of civil servants and their wages and socio-economic factors like literacy rate, education level, and per capita income.\n\nMunicipalities governed through a system of local participatory democracy were found to increase access to electricity, sewerage, and education faster than those communities ruled by political parties. In a study of public good provision in poor communities in Oaxaca, Mexico, Diaz-Cayeros et al. (2013) estimated the effects of usos y costumbres-a form of participatory democracy prevalent in indigenous communities-on the provision of local public goods. The research design benefited from an important institutional innovation in the state that allowed indigenous communities to choose their forms of governance. To assess the effects of local governance institutions on the provision of public goods, the authors used propensity score matching and a first differences approach to generate inferences from observational data.\n\n# Indicators \n\n- The effectiveness of participatory budgeting was operationalized using proxies based on financial indicators of local public administration including: level of own revenue collection and spending on public capital (Zamboni 2007). The rationale is that effective PB leads to increases in taxes collected, improved local government financial management, and increased capital spending.\n- Diaz-Cayeros et al. (2013) also assessed the effectiveness of participatory budgeting in terms of the allocation of funds for service provision. In this case, where communities could self-select to use either a form of participatory democracy or to be ruled by a political party, a matching procedure was designed to create an appropriate counterfactual through which equally poor, isolated, indigenous communities could be compared in their forms of governance. The dependent variable was the rate of change of public good coverage, in terms of the percentage of the municipal households who have water, sewerage, electricity, and that are illiterate.\n- Another type of indicator used by Baiocchi et al. (2004) was based on perceptions of the effectiveness of participatory governance. This was measured by key actors in local government and civil society as well as a compilation of socio-economic data. Better governance was measured as a variation in the number of and nature of offences found by auditors in the course of the random audits program with respect to the level of compliance with public sector management guidelines and legal requirements at the local level.",
      "18": "Participatory budgeting can lead to increased public services, more transparent delivery, and a greater effort to target poor communities. Twelve country case studies in Brazil, India, Kenya, Uganda, Sri Lanka and St Vincent illustrated various successes from the introduction of participatory budgeting. For example, in different parts of Kenya, extensive citizen participation led to improved revenue collection and new projects targeted toward the poor. They were successfully implemented because local residents oversaw the projects (Blore, Devas and Staler 2004). Likewise, the \"Kerala experiment\" in India increased projects for the poor through PB. The \"people's campaign\" for democratic decentralization mobilized hundreds of thousands of activists and volunteers to plan and help implement projects for not only the poor but also the \"untouchable scheduled caste and scheduled tribe populations\" who rarely benefited from project funds (Isaac and Franke 2002). It also brought about special projects for women as well as encouraged female elected officials and activists to participate in public life. There were major breakthroughs in the delivery of public services such as drinking water, sanitation, roads, education and public health services. Outside observers and local residents reported that public services were delivered for the people who needed it most.\n\n# Indicators \n\nSuccess in delivering services to the poor was measured through project outcomes, by Isaac and Franke (2002), including:\n\n- number of houses built for the poor (i.e. members of scheduled or former untouchable caste and tribal caste);\n- number of sanitary latrines and percentage of households with access to latrines, within 200 meters;\n- number of persons with job training and percentage reduction in unemployment rate; number of cooperatives; and\n- number of women in new job areas outside the home.\n\n\n## PB led to more pro-poor projects through changes in the decision making process in which poor citizens had privileged access and therefore higher levels of participation (Cabannes\n\n2004). For instance, the over-representation of poor among participants gave them additional power in the participatory budgeting deliberations. Further, the formula used to distribute funds to make other institutional decisions such as boundaries of different regions, gave preference to the poorest neighborhoods that had the weakest infrastructure. For instance, there was an increase in municipal spending on primary education, sanitation, housing and paving, all of which were primarily areas of deficiency in poor neighborhoods.\n\n## Indicators\n\n- Public services for the poor were measured by access to services and infrastructure. For example, indicators included: proportion of household with access and connections to potable water sources and municipal sewerage systems; percentage increase in number of paved roads (in kilometers); garbage service and street lighting.\n- Investments were also measured by average minimum salaries by head of households across neighborhoods.\n\n\n### 4.3 The effects of participatory budgeting on poverty outcomes",
      "19": "Participatory budgeting is linked to positive impacts on poverty reduction through its ability to redirect budget allocations to pro-poor investments and better implement them. In the previous section, we presented evidence that PB can increase budget allocations to propoor projects and that it can also lead to smoother implementation of related projects. The studies below demonstrate the final link to poverty impact and how the pro-poor projects implemented due to PB alleviated poverty to a degree under certain conditions.\n\nPB was significantly related to reducing extreme poverty. Baiocchi, Heller, Chaudhuri and Silva (2006) show that implementing participatory budgeting in 5,507 municipalities in Brazil translated into direct, tangible developmental benefits for the poor. Municipalities with PB were compared to those without PB to determine whether municipalities' performance improved due to PB over time. The statistical analysis showed that on average, PB increased progress in reducing extreme poverty by more than $40 \\%$, controlling for all other factors (initial condition and selection bias). There were overall improvements in the economy as well as for the poor. For example, there was a raised index of progress in reducing the GINI coefficient of income inequality by $.05 \\%$, and a reduced share of income earned by the richest ten percent by over five percentage points.\n\nPB contributed to improved development outcomes. The study by Baiocchi et al. (2006) found that participatory budgeting led to significant improvements in services for the poor including an increase in the percentage of municipal expenditures to health and sanitation; raised index of progress towards universal access to the municipal water network; and a raised index of progress in reducing overall poverty and also specifically among children. Goncalves (2013) similarly confirmed that the adoption of participatory budgeting at the municipal level is associated with increased expenditures on basic sanitation and health services and that this reallocation led to a significant reduction in infant mortality. The analysis was based on a panel data set comprising municipal level information on the adoption of participatory budgeting, public expenditures and health outcomes in Brazil from 1990 to 2004\n\n# Indicators \n\nParticipatory budgeting outcomes were operationalized by Baiocchi et al. (2006) along four dimensions: municipal finances, public service delivery, human development, and growth and inequality. The indicators were measured as follows.\n\n- Municipal finance: Share of capital expenditures; Share of expenditures on education and crime; health and sanitation; housing and urban development; social assistance and pensions; and share of the budget deficit\n- Public service delivery: Percentage of population with access to basic public services including: municipal trash collection services sanitation systems, water systems and electricity connection\n- Human development: Human Development Index, infant mortality rate (per 1,000), under-five mortality rate (per 1,000), percentage of children ages who are not in school by age group (7-14 or 15-17)\n- Growth and inequality: per capita annual income; percentage of population who are poor, percentage of population who are indigent, percentage of children ages 14 and below who are poor, and/or who are indigent; Income share (\\%) of poorest $20 \\%$ of population;",
      "20": "income share (\\%) of richest 10 percent of the population; gini coefficient of income inequality\n\n# 4.4 The conditions under which PB is more and less effective \n\nSome approaches to participatory budgeting work better under certain conditions. McGee and Gaventa (2013) noted that \"the impact of participatory budgeting in Porto Alegre, with the city's long history of citizen engagement and (at the time of innovation) a political leadership highlight committed to its success, sets it apart from other contexts which lack these contextual conditions\" (p.S19). In this case, participation by poor citizens in budgetary decision-making led to sharp increases in the reach and coverage of essential services, particularly among the poor when there was a partnership between the executive branch and an activist civil society (Baiocchi et al. 2004, Sousa Santos 2005, World Bank 2008).\n\nThe World Bank's impact evaluation of PB in Porte Alegre showed that PB led to improved access to piped water and sewerage. Moreover, PB served as a mechanism for improving propoor capital investments that contributed to the amelioration of living conditions for the poor, that is, when PB was adopted for at least ten years.\n\nIn contrast to the direct participatory approach, Ireland's tripartite approach to participation brought together government, trade unions and producer organizations under the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) through which they engaged in long-term yearly consultations on the economic strategy including tax policy and expenditures. The results indicated that the PB delegate approach was successful in the long term in contributing broadly to growth and macroeconomic stability, rather than solely focused on the poor (Brautigam 2004).\n\nAn analysis of ten Latin American countries showed that Chile and Costa Rica's outcomes related to pro-poor spending in various sectors were most effective compared to other countries yet citizens did not participate in the budgeting process. The findings suggested that rather than participation by the poor directly, it was participation by pro-poor political parties and coalitions that were key to pro-poor budgeting (see also Wampler 2004). This conclusion was also supported by the case of Mauritius where the poor were represented through a progressive left of center political party, which encouraged participation, by the citizenry in budget consultations.\n\n## Indicators\n\nPro-poor spending outcome indicators in various sectors included:\n\n- adult literacy rate\n- proportion of population with improved sanitation\n- proportion of population with access to water sources\n- under-5 mortality rate\n- life expectancy at birth\n- Human Development Index value",
      "21": "Data were based on rankings by panels of country experts on different aspects of transparency and citizen participation collected in a survey by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (Brautigam 2004).\n\n# 5. Conclusions and Implications \n\nWe found emerging support in the literature for the first key question we set out to answer, which was whether or not we could find evidence of institutional impact on poverty outcomes. The findings in the literature show linkages between the institutional changes achieved by participatory budget initiatives and improvements in the access of the poor to better quality services. Under certain conditions, open budgeting practices can contribute to development impact.\n\nTransparency, particularly as assessed by the Open Budget Index, is a predictor of child and infant health outcomes and access to improved drinking water. Accountability mechanisms have been found to contribute to similar improvements in human development indicators.\nParticipatory budgeting, in terms of the devolution of decision-making authority to local actors, has been associated with improvements in public management and service delivery and has been significantly related to the reduction of extreme poverty. In short, the available evidence underscores the need to better understand how participation, transparency, and accountability in budget processes and policies matter and under what conditions.\n\nAn incremental non-linear results chain best articulates the process through which institutional changes in open budgeting can contribute to higher-level human development outcomes. Together, the analyses included as part of this review suggested that the basic steps in this logical sequence and their ongoing interaction for mutual reinforcement are positioned as shown in the figure below.",
      "22": "Figure 1. Open Budgeting Higher Level Results Chain\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nAn examination of the incremental changes leading from open budgeting to human development outcomes highlights some key dynamics through which the needed changes are sustained and/or strengthened to support intermediate outcomes related to improvements in program delivery. Logical links or ongoing loops in this sequence therefore include:\n\n- Interdependency among transparency, participation and accountability. Local actors play important roles for holding government accountable during the budget cycle and fostering the transparency of budget information. Transparency, in turn, is critical for enabling participation, providing the information that local actors need for priority setting. Public sector entities that are held accountable are more likely over time to keep their budget policies and processes transparent and to support a participatory process in setting priorities.\n- The subsequent achievement of key, often mutually reinforcing, intermediate development outcomes. Institutional changes do not lead directly to poverty impact. Instead, the majority of studies focus on smaller incremental steps related to improving the allocation and execution of budgets for more efficient spending, enhancing budgets available to address pro-poor priorities, and reducing the diversion of funds for unintended expenditures (e.g. corruption).",
      "23": "- Improved program or service delivery as the key lever for influencing development impact. Enhancing budgets and using them more efficiently are important outcomes because they allow for more or better service delivery, which potentially broadens the access of the poor to better quality services and ultimately effects human development outcomes. In some cases, the institutional changes occurring through open budgeting can affect the quality of services directly, particularly through the use of accountability mechanisms for quality assurance and improvement purposes.\n\nThe review of available evidence therefore confirms that targeted institutional changes related to open budgeting might matter for higher-level development outcomes. There is a recurring set of measurable attributes related to transparency, accountability and participation that can help to increase the access of the poor to higher quality services. However, the literature also presents a formidable caveat for development planning, which is that the specific potential benefits of these institutional changes will always be determined in part by the local context and the presence of certain accompanying conditions.\n\nOne of the key questions we sought to answer with this research was whether or not we could identify a set of core leading indicators that could serve as a tool to help ensure that open budgeting practitioners are on the right track. The findings show this proves to be a challenge due to the need to define a nuanced and incremental results chain within each unique context. Further inquiry is necessary based on action research where institutional changes are identified and codified during program design and revised based on real data and experiences during project implementation.\n\nOutcomes of institutional impact will then be easier to track with existing baselines and monitoring data which will make it possible to assess long-term poverty impact. Currently, the research does not document key institutional changes and link them to outcomes. However, the literature has highlighted key characteristics or areas for measurement related to transparency, accountability, and participation that help to indicate that the needed changes are happening if certain accompanying conditions and factors are also in place.\n\nPractitioners have proven methods for measuring common development outcomes (e.g. infant mortality, access to potable water, etc.), but effective approaches for measuring the less tangible institutional changes related to open budgeting in order to trace their relationship to development outcomes have been more elusive. This review of the evidence provides initial guidance on how transparency, accountability and participation can be measured and what conditions should accompany these institutional changes to facilitate their contribution to higherlevel development impact.\n\nRather than the establishment of standard indicators, this review highlights which aspects of the institutional change are valid for measurement and what accompanying factors to consider. A list of these areas and conditions is presented in the table below. The specific methods and indicators appropriate for assessing transparency, accountability, and participation will depend on the local context.",

Documenting these change processes over time would help practitioners to plan for and assess the effectiveness of knowledge initiatives. Overall, this review serves as a starting point and underscores the need for further investigation to establish effective measurement practices of institutional change and build an evidence base for understanding the relative robustness of institutional change paths and the context in which they are likely to matter. We recommend that WBI begin to collect such data with its Open Budgeting program to advance our understanding of institutional impact on poverty in this area.",

      "1": "# Abstract \n\nChina has a large deficit of females, and public policies have sought to reduce the son preference that is widely believed to cause this. Recently a study has suggested that up to 75 percent of this deficit is attributable to hepatitis B infection, indicating that immunization programs should form the first plank of policy interventions. However, a large medical dataset from Taiwan (China) shows that hepatitis B infection raises women's probability of having a son by only 0.25 percent. And demographic data from China show that the only group of women who have elevated probabilities\nof bearing a son are those who have already borne daughters. This pattern makes it difficult to see how any biological factor can explain a large part of the imbalance in China's sex ratios at birth-unless it can be shown that it somehow selectively affects those who have borne girls, or causes them to first bear girls and then boys. The Taiwanese data suggest that this is not the case with hepatitis B, since its impact is unaffected by the sex composition of previous births. The data support the cultural, rather than the biological, explanation for the \"missing women.\"\n\nThis paper-a product of the Human Development and Public Services Team, Development Research Group-is part of a larger effort in the department to study social institutions and development outcomes.

      "3": "China has a very large deficit of females, ${ }^{1}$ and public policies have sought hard to reduce the son preference which is widely believed to cause this. The Chinese government has sought to increase gender equity through a wide range of interventions aimed at changing people's perception that girls are less desirable than boys, as well as to bring women firmly into public life. These interventions include, inter alia, vigorous media campaigns to change ideas about gender roles and equity; legislation to enhance gender equity; and sponsoring grassroots women's organizations. ${ }^{2}$ Financial incentives to parents to raise daughters are yet another tool used to this end: they were used by some Chinese clans even in the nineteenth century (Hsu 1948), and revived recently by the Chinese government (Xinhua 2006).\n\nThe assumption underlying such policies is that a strong preference for sons is driving the imbalance in sex ratios. Recently, Emily Oster has strongly challenged this assumption, arguing that up to 75 percent of the female deficit in China can be accounted for by the high prevalence of hepatitis B infection (Oster 2005). This would suggest that instead of focusing primarily on the difficult task of altering parental preference for sons, the first plank of policy interventions should instead be the much simpler task of immunizing people against hepatitis B.\n\nThere is indeed much evidence that biological factors drive gender differentials in health outcomes. ${ }^{3}$ Studies have also shown that the overall sex ratio at birth in Sweden rose by a couple of percentage points over some centuries as women's nutritional status improved, ${ }^{4}$ and it is possible that some biological factors could have a much larger impact on sex ratios at birth. We therefore consider Oster's hypothesis carefully, reviewing the demographic and medical evidence for and against it. We conclude that the data indicate that hepatitis B infection has a very marginal effect on the proportion of \"missing girls\" in China. Further, we conclude that the patterns of sex ratio at birth in China (as also in other Asian countries) are difficult to reconcile with a large role of biological factors of any kind.\n\n# I Studies of the relationship between HBV status and sex ratios at birth \n\n## 1. Evidence from micro-studies\n\nSix micro-studies carried out by medical scientists researching hepatitis B found a relationship between this disease and the sex ratio of births. Blumberg (2006a) summarizes these results:\n\"In a study in Greece, families in which either parent was a carrier of HBV had a higher ratio of boys to girls than in families where the parents (particularly the mother) had antiHBs (Table 1).... Similar studies were done in five other populations; they were consistent with the initial results.\"\n\nChahnazarian et al. (1988) summarized the results of these studies. They noted that the populations studied were very small and therefore the sex ratios fluctuate between the studies. Thus the precise magnitude of the effect is unclear, although the pattern is clear. They tried hard to dissect the data from three studies which included data on the hepatitis B infection status (HBV status) of both parents, to see whether the father's or the mother's carrier status had a larger effect, but concluded that \"It is not clear whether hepatitis B antigen (carrier status) in the father and in the mother has differential effects on the sex ratio at birth.\" Such questions have a potential relevance for the medical sciences which goes far beyond that of sex ratios at birth. For example, Blumberg (1976) points out that \"This connection of HBV with sex selection may also",
      "4": "explain why there is a greater likelihood of rejection of male kidneys by renal patients with antiHBs, and indicate how kidneys can be better selected for transplantation\".\n\n# 2. Oster's (2005) study \n\nStruck by these findings, Oster (2005) set out to test them on a population level in a large number of countries. She uses a variety of data and analytical approaches, including cross-country analyses, time-series evidence using a natural experiment based on vaccination campaigns in Alaska and Taiwan (China), and finally an estimation of the percent of the female deficit in China and India that is attributable to hepatitis B.\n\nThis is not an easy task. ${ }^{5}$ Firstly, the estimates of the prevalence of hepatitis B have to be derived from scattered studies, which often represent a minuscule fraction of the country's population. As she says: \"HBV prevalence is calculated as by aggregating published studies.... Only countries with more than 2500 people tested for HBV (combining all studies) are used in the analysis.\" (Oster 2005: footnote to Table 10, parentheses mine). Secondly, she derives an indirect estimate of the effect of HBV status on the sex ratio at birth, since the direct estimates from the microstudies were based on such small numbers.\n\nShe finds that her cross-country analysis shows a clear correlation between the sex ratio at birth and the prevalence of hepatitis B. However, she notes that due to issues of data quality, these regressions omit data from Sub-Saharan Africa, where the sex ratio at birth is low and levels of HBV prevalence are high (Oster 2005:1196). Below we discuss that the issues of data quality she raises for Africa are applicable also to many other developing countries which she includes in her analysis - including India, which she analyzes extensively.\n\nShe also finds that in Alaska the vaccination campaigns clearly reduced the sex ratio at birth, but that this relationship is less clear in Taiwan (China). In fact, the Taiwanese vital statistics show that the sex ratio at birth hovered around 109 in the years 1996-2002, and rose slightly to 110 in 2003-2004. ${ }^{6}$ This does not suggest that the vaccination campaign had any significant effect on the sex ratio at birth, since as she says the vaccination campaign started in 1984, so \"women who are vaccinated in 1984 would be 15 by 1999\".\n\nShe then calculates the proportion of \"missing women\" in China and India that can be explained by the prevalence of hepatitis B , combining her estimates of \"the prevalence of hepatitis B and estimates of the effect of hepatitis on the sex ratio at birth to estimate and adjust the number of missing women.\" These appear to be estimates of the impact only of the mother's (not the father's) HBV status, since she states that the prevalence data pertain to pregnant women only (Oster 2005: footnote to Table 10).\n\nUsing these estimates of HBV prevalence and impact on the sex ratio at birth, she estimates that up to 75 percent of the \"missing women\" in China in the early 1990s is attributable to parental infection with hepatitis B. Her conclusions are striking, and have received much attention. ${ }^{7}$ Given their strong implications for policy, they warrant deeper exploration with more robust data.",
      "5": "# 3. Lin and Luoh's (2007) study from Taiwan (China) \n\nFortunately, there is a very large national longitudinal dataset from Taiwan (China), which permits a robust estimation of the impact of mother's HBV status on sex ratios at birth. These data were collected for a national Hepatitis B immunization program, covering up to 90 percent of births. It was especially important to test pregnant women's HBV status, because an additional dose of Hepatitis B immune globulin had to be given within 24 hours of birth to babies born to women who had tested positive.\n\nUsing the data collected between 1988 and 1999, Lin and Luoh (2007) were able to track the sex ratio of births to women whose HBV status was known. They found that women who were infected had only a 0.25 percent higher probability of having a son than other women. With a prevalence of hepatitis B infection as high as 15 percent in the population, this translates into an increase of only 0.16 percent in the overall sex ratio at birth, raising it from a baseline of 105 to 105.165. The sex ratio at birth for all the births in the dataset was 109, so the exercise of son preference accounts for all but a tiny part of the elevation in the overall sex ratio at birth.\n\nOster estimates that the prevalence of HBV among pregnant women in China is $11.24 \\%$, and that this should result in a sex ratio at birth of 1.10 (2005:Table 10). This is the basis for her estimate that HBV accounts for the bulk of excess male births in China (Oster 2005: 1201-2). However, the findings from the detailed medical dataset from Taiwan (China), indicate that she has massively overestimated the impact of maternal hepatitis B infection on the sex ratio at birth.\n\n## 4. Oster's (2007) new hypothesis\n\nIn response to Lin and Luoh's (2007) study, Oster has revised the premise of her argument. She now concludes that the effect of HBV on the sex ratio at birth is driven largely by the father's HBV status, and that mother's HBV status plays at most a much weaker role (Blumberg and Oster 2007). As in her previous paper, she uses multiple approaches to arrive at her conclusions ${ }^{8}$ : \"We present three pieces of evidence that this may be the case. First, using two of the original datasets on this topic we find that father's infection is more strongly correlated with sex ratio than mother's infection. Second, in population-level data from Taiwan we find that paternal cohort infection rates are more important that maternal cohort infection rates. Finally, we show using the IPUMS dataset that children born in the United States to men born in China are more likely to be boys, but this finding does not hold for children born to women from China.\"\n\nEach of these analytical approaches raises some questions. First, she revisits the three individuallevel datasets on the basis of which Chahnazarian, Blumberg and London (1988) concluded that sex ratios at birth were elevated if either parent was an HBV carrier, and that the data did not permit them to conclude that one parent's status was more important that the other's. Oster selects two of these three datasets (Greece 1 and the Philippines), and runs regressions on them to show that only the father's HBV status is significantly associated with a more masculine sex ratio at birth, not the mother's. This conclusion is at odds with the previous analyses.\n\nThis conclusion is also at odds with the evidence from the larger study in Greece, which includes information only on mother's HBV status (Livadas et al 1979, reproduced here in Table 1). This study records a similar increase in sex ratio at birth associated with mother's HBV status as the two datasets Oster re-analyzes to conclude that elevated sex ratios at birth are related solely to father's HBV status. Unless there was a near-perfect correlation between mother's and father's",
      "6": "HBV status, the data from Livadas et al's (1979) study would be inconsistent with Oster's reformulated hypothesis.\n\nHer second approach uses population-level data from Taiwan (China). Using data on HBV prevalence by age from testing done in primary school, she constructs expected HBV prevalence by 5-year age cohort. She then examines the sex ratio of children born to parents who belong to different age cohorts, so their probability of infection differs. Once again, she finds that only the expected HBV of the father's cohort affects the sex ratio at birth. It is difficult to assess this information since she does not present basic information on the data, such as the number of agecohorts available for this analysis. ${ }^{9}$\n\nHer third approach uses United States census data to look for patterns in the sex ratios of children born to Chinese immigrants, who are assumed to have levels of HBV prevalence similar to their place of origin. She finds that Chinese couples have an elevated sex ratio, as do Chinese men who marry non-Chinese. However, Chinese women who marry non-Chinese do not show an elevated sex ratio at birth. She interprets this as showing that only paternal HBV status drives the elevated sex ratio at birth. However, there could be a completely different explanation for this. The literature on son preference in China highlights the fact that people want sons in order to continue the husband's lineage - not that of the wife, since a woman cannot continue her own lineage. Even if married to an American-born woman, a Chinese-born man would still be subject to pressure to continue his lineage, but this would not apply to a Chinese-born woman married to an American-born man.\n\nThere are thus several questions that arise about Oster's evidence that it is the father's and not the mother's HBV status that causes the elevated sex ratios at birth. In any case, the demographic evidence below indicate that hepatitis B (whether of the father or the mother) cannot account, as Oster has argued, for the bulk of the female deficit in China.\n\n# II The Demographic Evidence \n\n## 1. Whether a girl goes \"missing\" in China depends heavily on whether she has older sisters\n\nA very clear pattern emerges from the third of a million births in the one percent sample of the 1990 Chinese census. Note that this pertains to births during 1989-90, which is close in time to that for which Oster made her calculations on the proportion of the female deficit in China attributable to HBV (Oster 2005, Table 11). This enormous database of births shows that the only group of women with elevated probabilities of bearing a son is those who have already borne daughters (Figure 1). Those who have borne only son(s) show a mildly elevated probability of the next child being a girl - indicative of a mild preference for having a daughter if the sons are already safely in place.\n\nA study of the sex ratio of aborted fetuses in China (Gu and Roy 1995, see Table 2) shows a pattern entirely consistent with that of the sex ratio of births - namely, that women who have only daughters account for the bulk of the excess of female fetuses among the total abortions. A similar pattern of son preference is found across Asia, showing that parental discrimination against girls is related to the sex composition of their children. Studies in India, Bangladesh, and South Korea, ${ }^{10}$ based on data from before the availability of sex-selection technology (when households resorted to infanticide or discrimination during early childhood), show that girls born",
      "7": "to a family which already had a daughter suffered sharply elevated mortality compared to other children. After sex-selective technology became widely available, the South Asian and South Korean data indicate that the use of this technology is strongly correlated with the sex composition of existing children ${ }^{11}$ — just as in China.\n\nIt is striking that across East and South Asia all the indicators - sex ratios at birth, sex ratios of aborted fetuses, and sex ratios of child mortality - show the same pattern of manipulation of family composition by parents, consistent with strong son preference. Whether or not females \"go missing\" is determined by the existing sex composition of the family into which they are conceived. This suggests that cultural factors still provide the overwhelming explanation for the female deficit.\n\nFor Oster's hypotheses to be consistent with the demographic data, women (or their husbands) would have to be especially prone to contracting hepatitis B if they had borne a daughter. Or the disease would have to somehow lead to women first bearing daughters followed by an excess of sons. Either of these scenarios would require a much more complex set of biological factors to be at work than is indicated by Oster or by the micro-studies she cites.\n\nIs it possible that somehow hepatitis B works in these very complex ways? Lin and Luoh's (2007) large medical dataset makes it possible to examine this issue. First, they show that the impact of maternal HBV status is fairly constant across birth orders (Figure 2). HBV+ and HBVwomen show a similar sharp rise in the sex ratio at birth by birth order. This is consistent with studies across Asia, which show that parents who have not yet borne a son have a higher probability of progressing to higher order births, and become increasingly desperate to assure that they have a son. ${ }^{12}$ The fact that the HBV impact is fairly constant across birth orders suggests that this impact is unaffected by the sex composition of previous births.\n\nBut Lin and Luoh (2007: Table 6) go further to test the possibility that some complex biological factor makes women who are HBV+ more prone to bearing a son if they had previously borne girls. Their findings do not support this hypothesis. For women who have a third birth, the sex ratios at birth of HBV+ women remain marginally higher than that of HBV- women - but there is no significant additional impact of HBV status on the sex ratio at birth of the third child if the previous children were all female. Table 3 summarizes the sex ratios at birth by sex composition of previous births and mother's HBV status. It shows that women who have not yet borne a son have a much higher sex ratio of the third birth - but HBV status makes little difference to this.\n\n# 2. The population-level evidence from Africa \n\nOster notes that Sub-Saharan Africa appears to offer evidence contrary to her hypothesis: \"to the extent that it is possible to tell, it seems that Africa has relatively low sex ratios and relatively high HBV prevalence\". She notes that the absence of high-quality birth registration data from Africa make it difficult to use the data on sex ratios at birth. She therefore compiles data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) carried out in 18 Sub-Saharan African countries, cautioning that these survey data suffer from defects such as recall bias. She carries out some regressions on these data and concludes that \"these results provide some comfort that Africa is not a particular challenge to the robustness of the HBV-sex ratio connection\" (Oster 2005:1198).\n\nBut the limitations of African birth registration data apply also to many developing countries. This is why the DHS data are widely used to obtain estimates of the sex ratio at birth — including",
      "8": "for India, a country which Oster analyzes extensively - and if anything the recall bias towards male births would be expected to be higher in India than in Sub-Saharan Africa given the stronger son preference in India. Also odd is the fact that she does not use Garenne's (2002) compilation and analysis of data on sex ratios at birth from 56 DHS surveys conducted in Sub-Saharan Africa. This covers 29 countries, since several countries had more than one survey spaced some years apart.\n\nNeither Garenne's compilation of the DHS data nor the UN estimates show high sex ratios at birth in the African countries that Oster lists as having an especially high prevalence of HBV (Table 4). This is another piece of evidence that neither parent's HepB status makes a significant difference to the sex ratio at birth.\n\n# III Conclusions \n\nThe Chinese data strongly support the cultural explanation for the female deficit - namely, that the high sex ratios at birth in China result largely from parental preference for sons. They show that whether or not females \"go missing\" depends heavily on the existing sex composition of the family into which they are conceived. Girls with no older sisters have similar chances of survival as boys. However, girls conceived in families which already have a daughter experience steeply higher probabilities of being aborted or of dying in early childhood.\n\nThe demographic data are very difficult to reconcile with Oster's hypothesis that most of the imbalance in the sex ratios at birth in China is attributable to the prevalence of hepatitis B. Whether it is via the mother's infection status or the father's, the hepatitis B hypothesis is difficult to reconcile with the fact that the only group of women who have elevated probabilities of bearing a son are those who have already borne daughters.\n\nIndeed, it is difficult to see how any biological hypothesis can explain a significant part of the imbalance in China's sex ratios at birth - given the strong relationship between the sex of children already born and the probability of the next child being a boy - unless it can be shown that the biological factor works in very complex ways such that it selectively affects those women (or men) who have borne girls, or causes them to first bear girls and then boys.\n\nThe medical data from Taiwan (China) are very interesting. Firstly, they show that hepatitis B infection raised women's probability of having a son by only 0.25 percent. Secondly, they show that the effect of HBV status is fairly constant across birth orders even though the sex ratio at birth rises sharply by birth order - suggests strongly that the impact of HBV status is unaffected by the sex composition of previous births. Thirdly, they show that HBV+ status does not selectively affect women who have borne girls - there is no significant additional impact of HBV status on the sex ratio at birth of the third child if the previous children were all female. This seems to rule out the possibility that biological factors can explain the complex patterns found in the demographic data.\n\nOster's hypothesis is interesting, but it cannot explain more than a very small part of the totality of the female deficit phenomenon in China. It appears that the governments of these countries have been correct to focus their policies on changing the cultural roots of son preference.",

      "1": "# Summary findings \n\nAs a symptom of fundamental institutional weaknesses, corruption needs to be viewed within a broader governance framework. It thrives where the state is unable to reign over its bureaucracy, to protect property and contractual rights, or to provide institutions that support the rule of law. Furthermore, governance failures at the national level cannot be isolated from the interface between the corporate and state sectors, in particular from the heretofore underemphasized influence that firms may exert on the state. Under certain conditions, corporate strategies may exacerbate misgovernance at the national level.\n\nAn in-depth empirical assessment of the links between corporate behavior and national governance can thus provide particular insights. The 1999 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS) - the transition economies component of the ongoing World Business Environment Survey - assesses in detail the various dimensions of governance from the perspective of about 3,000 firms in 20 countries. After introducing the survey framework and measurement\napproach, Hellman, Jones, Kaufmann, and Schankerman present the survey results, focusing on governance, corruption, and state capture.\n\nBy unbundling governance into its many dimensions, BEEPS permits an in-depth empirical assessment. The authors pay special attention to certain forms of grand corruption, notably state capture by parts of the corporate sector - that is, the propensity of firms to shape the underlying rules of the game by \"purchasing\" decrees, legislation, and influence at the central bank, which is found to be prevalent in a number of transition economies. The survey also measures other dimensions of grand corruption, including those associated with public procurement, and quantifies the more traditional (\"pettier\") forms of corruption.\n\nCross-country surveys may suffer from bias if firms tend to systematically over- or underestimate the extent of problems within their country. The authors provide a new test for this potential bias, finding little evidence of country perception bias in BEEPS.\n\nThis paper - a joint product of Governance, Regulation, and Finance, World Bank Institute, and the Chief Economist's Office, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - is part of a larger program to measure governance and corruption worldwide.

      "6": "# 1. Introduction \n\nThe search for effective methods of combating corruption has led to an increasingly wide recognition that corruption is fundamentally a problem of governance. Corruption thrives where states are too weak to control their own bureaucrats, to protect property and contract rights, and to provide the institutions that underpin an effective rule of law. Consequently, recent studies of corruption have tended to focus on key characteristics and policies of the state, especially the extent of state intervention in the economy and the degree of discretionary power of bureaucrats. ${ }^{1}$ Yet the recognition that corruption is a symptom of the underlying weakness of the state, while important, has shifted the focus of analysis away from firms. ${ }^{2}$ The links between corporate governance and national governance have been largely unexplored. Moreover, empirical efforts to assess governance and corruption across countries have generally overlooked the critical information that firms can provide about the nature and extent of these problems.\n\nThe 1999 Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS), building upon the World Bank's survey carried out for the World Development Report in $1997^{3}$ and the ongoing World Business Environment Survey, was designed to assess the quality of governance across 20 countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union from a firmlevel perspective. ${ }^{4}$ This perspective provides a number of advantages. First, it allows us to explore the relationship between different characteristics of firms (such as ownership, control, size, sector, etc.) and their effects on the firms' interactions with the state. Second, it provides an opportunity to investigate in depth the types of \"services\" for which firms pay bribes and the characteristics of these transactions. Third, it provides a micro-economic perspective on the costs and benefits to firms associated with corruption and different levels of governance.\n\nMost importantly, the firm-level perspective provides one of the first opportunities to analyse empirically the problem of \"state capture,\" that is, the efforts of firms to shape and influence the underlying rules of the game (i.e. legislation, laws, rules, and decrees) through private payments to public officials. There has been analysis of how firms in the transition economies use their political influence to distort both the legal framework and the policymaking process in an effort to gain concentrated rents with detrimental consequences for the economy and society at large. ${ }^{5}$ The BEEPS provides the first opportunity to explore empirically the methods and mechanisms by which firms seek to influence the state, providing a new perspective on the phenomenon of state capture in the region and opening insights into larger questions of the political economy of reform.\n\nThe BEEPS was designed to push further the empirical frontier in the analysis of governance and corruption at the country and firm levels. Most existing cross-country surveys of governance and corruption rely on the subjective views of outsiders, namely expert assessments, country analysts or foreign investors. ${ }^{6}$ Governance is often defined quite narrowly,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ For example, see the World Development Report (1997).\n    ${ }^{2}$ An exception is the recent work by Shleifer and Vishny (1994).\n    ${ }^{3}$ See Brunetti, Kisunko and Weder (1997).\n    ${ }^{4}$ The BEEPS is the first stage of a world-wide survey of firms on the obstacles in the business environment conducted by the World Bank in co-operation with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Inter-American Development Bank and the Harvard Institute for International Development. It is anticipated that over 100 countries will be included in the survey encompassing countries at all levels of development. An earlier version of the World Business Environment Survey, comprising 69 countries, was carried out 1996 and presented in the World Bank's World Development Report 1997 (the data are available at www.worldbank.org/wbi/gac). Some of the data from the BEEPS were first published in the EBRD's Transition Report (1999).\n    ${ }^{5}$ See Aslund (1999) and Hellman (1998).\n    ${ }^{6}$ The most frequently used index of corruption is Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index, which is a survey of surveys based on outside assessments of corruption and on a particular methodology subject to changes over time (as well as its country coverage, which even though it has grown over the years, currently covers only about one-half of all countries for which there is data). At any rate, any such aggregate comparative index will have serious limitations in diagnosing in-depth governance and corruption challenges within a country. For that purpose, a new set of diagnostic survey tools (for public officials, enterprises and citizens) have been developed under a separate project to help countries in addressing governance challenges (Kaufmann, Pradhan and Ryterman, 1998).",
      "7": "taking a uni-dimensional view of the state's role in the economy or assessing the rule of law broadly defined. Corruption is typically limited to bribery and focused primarily on what is often described as \"petty corruption\" or \"grease payments\". The results of such surveys are thus highly subjective and estimated with a large margin of error that inhibits cross-country comparisons. ${ }^{7}$ Moreover, the assessment of governance and corruption as broad catch-all categories has not proven to be an effective tool for developing specific and well-targeted policy advice for governments, civil society and IFIs in these areas.\n\nThe BEEPS has a range of features to ensure higher reliability and greater depth in assessing these problems. Questions are based on the direct experience of firms rather than subjective comparisons across countries. Where possible, numerical cardinal estimates of problems are used (such as share of annual revenue spent on bribes) as opposed to subjective assessments of the extent of the problem. Data on firm-level performance in terms of sales, investment and employment provide specific estimates of the costs and benefits to firms associated with governance issues. These estimates enable us to measure the margin of error on many questions, which is explicitly depicted in many charts contained in the paper.\n\nBy defining governance in terms of a number of distinct dimensions, the BEEPS provides a much more detailed and in-depth understanding of the nature of governance problems. The survey contains individual modules on taxes and regulation, macroeconomic management, physical infrastructure, competition and the provision of law and order. On corruption, the survey includes questions that distinguish among different forms of corruption, different recipients of bribes, and key characteristics of corrupt transactions. Moreover, the BEEPS represents the first major attempt to provide sound empirical measures of various forms of \"grand\" corruption, such as 'state capture' (purchase of laws and decrees by enterprises) as well as corruption in public procurement, and to measure the characteristics of firms that engage in such forms of corruption.\n\nThis is mostly a descriptive paper summarising the results of a subset of questions from the BEEPS relating to governance and corruption, as well as detailing the sample structure and methodology employed. For most questions, the results are reported at the country level, though the variation across different types of firms across countries is presented in some cases as well. Several indices are also constructed on the basis of different dimensions of governance to provide summary measures of broader concepts. We also address the problem of 'country perception bias', defined as the tendency of respondents from any country to systematically over- or under-estimate the extent of problems within their own country. A simple method for evaluating the extent of country perception bias is implemented, with little evidence found pointing to such bias in the BEEPS.\n\nThis paper is the first in this empirical project whose objective is to deepen our understanding of the linkages between corporate governance and national governance and how such interactions shape the environment faced by businesses in different countries. A forthcoming companion paper will analyse the characteristics and consequences of state capture in detail.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ For an analysis of existing governance and corruption indicators, see Kaufmann, Kraay and Zoido-Lobaton (1999a and b).",
      "8": "# 2. The survey instrument \n\n## Background on the questionnaire\n\nThe BEEPS questionnaire for the transition economies was developed jointly by the World Bank ${ }^{8}$ and the Office of the Chief Economist at the EBRD. ${ }^{9}$ The survey presented here was implemented during the period June through August 1999 in the following countries:\n\nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan.\n\n## Structure of the questionnaire\n\n## The questionnaire has two separate parts:\n\nAn initial \"screener\" questionnaire contains questions on the characteristics of the responding firm covering ownership, area of major activity, number of employees and internationalisation (including degree of foreign ownership and level of exports). These questions, in addition to providing information on the responding firm for use in its own right, were used to establish sample quotas. The sample selection procedure will be described in section 3.\n\nThe main questionnaire contains over 70 questions. The focus of this paper is on the governance-related questions; other questions will be addressed elsewhere. The aspects of the investment climate with which the survey deals can be classified broadly into macro- and micro- dimensions as follows:\n\n## Institutions and policies - macro-dimensions\n\nThis section deals with a broad range of issues relating to the efficiency and efficacy of government institutions and policies. Firms were asked to rate the quality of public services across a number of dimensions including central government, parliament, the judiciary, utilities and the police, and to evaluate how serious various institutional obstacles are for their business, ranging across macro- and micro-economic policy, crime and corruption. Questions were asked about the legal system and its ability to protect property and contract rights and the predictability and transparency of policy making. Finally, firms were asked about the extent to which they use barter, which is symptomatic of major institutional failure.\n\n## Bureaucracy, state intervention and corruption - micro-dimensions\n\nIn contrast to the above questions which focus on the public goods and institutional environment provided or not provided by the state, the second set of questions investigates the nature of the direct interactions between firms and the state. This includes not only an analysis of the extent and types of state intervention in the operations of firms, but also the ways in which firms seek to influence the state. On corruption, firms were asked about the extent and frequency of bribery, the recipients of bribes and the nature of the corrupt transaction. Finally, firms were asked about the specific benefits they receive from the state in the form of subsidies and toleration of arrears.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{8}$ The team at the World Bank comprised Daniel Kaufmann, Homi Kharas, Syamm Khemani, Guy Pfefferman, Andy Stone and Geeta Batra.

      "9": "# 3. Implementation and methodology \n\nThe survey instrument was prepared in English and then translated into the national language of each country. To ensure accuracy of translation the survey was independently translated back into English. The survey was extensively piloted in each of the countries in which it was implemented to ensure that respondents correctly understood the questions. As a qualitycontrol measure, a sub-sample of respondents was telephoned on the following day and the responses to key questions checked for consistency.\n\nThe selection of a representative sample of firms is crucial if inferences are to be drawn which apply beyond those firms interviewed. Sample selection took place in several stages. The government statistical office was contacted in each of the countries where the survey was conducted to obtain a breakdown of enterprises by industry sector, number of employees and location. Some judgement was necessary as there was considerable variation in the amount of information available in each country. This prior information was then used to construct a sample frame with quotas placed on the number of enterprises to be sampled in these categories. In addition, quotas were placed on the number of state-owned and private sector firms and the number of firms with foreign ownership. However, no attempt was made to construct a representative sample across these ownership strata and the quotas were designed only to ensure representation. The prior information that would be required to weight the sample in proportion to the universe of firms is unavailable in most of the countries covered by the survey.\n\nThe precise parameters of the quotas are as follows:\n\n- Industry sector: The number of manufacturing versus service companies was allocated according to their contribution to GDP with a $15 \\%$ minimum for each.\n- Number of employees: At least $15 \\%$ of the firms were required to have under 50 employees and $15 \\%$ were required to have over 200 employees.\n- Location: At least $15 \\%$ of the firms were required to be located in towns of fewer than 50,000 inhabitants or in rural areas.\n- Ownership: At least $15 \\%$ of the firms were required to have majority foreign ownership (or where this is prohibited by law, foreign ownership close to the legal maximum).\n- Exporters: At least $15 \\%$ of the firms were required to export at least $20 \\%$ of their output.\n- State Ownership: $20 \\%$ of the firms were required to be state-owned.\n\nFirms were sampled randomly from business directories or the Yellow Pages and the initial screener questionnaire conducted by telephone to select firms fulfilling the quota restrictions. After conducting the initial screener interview and securing the co-operation of the firm, the main questionnaire was carried out in a face-to-face interview by local interviewers trained according to a common format. This is the most effective method of implementing such a long questionnaire as postal surveys tend to suffer from a low response rate. This is particularly true in the transition countries since postal surveys tend to be associated with the bureaucracy of the Communist era. Further, telephone interviews do not generate a conducive atmosphere to deal with the sensitive issues covered by the survey. In all countries the survey was conducted by local staff of the international survey firm, A.C. Nielsen, to ensure consistency of training and approach across countries.",
      "10": "# Addressing Perception Respondent Bias in Cross-Country Surveys \n\nDespite this methodology, a potential source of bias remains with respect to making crosscountry comparisons. A respondent can be said to exhibit perception bias if he rates a problem more or less severely than would an objective observer (assuming of course that the survey question corresponds to an objectively measurable concept). Some respondents could be said to have an inherent tendency to kvetch (i.e. to \"complain, gripe, grunt, or sigh\") or to kvell (i.e. to \"beam with immense pride and pleasure\"). ${ }^{10}$ In general, such individual perception bias would only contribute to the standard error of the survey estimates without causing bias at the aggregate level. However, this conclusion requires that the perception bias be uncorrelated among the group of individuals aggregated in the survey. In cross-country surveys, there is always a concern that the individual biases could be correlated across respondents in any given country thus making the country aggregates correspondingly biased. In other words, some countries could generate a greater tendency for kvetching or kvelling among the respondents.\n\nThere are a variety of factors which could generate such a country perception bias including differences in national character and culture, differences in the degree of openness of respondents associated with alternative political systems or nation-wide factors related to the particular time period in which the survey was implemented (such as the recent exposure to a macroeconomic crisis or government corruption scandal). In this paper, an attempt is made to investigate such potential bias by examining the relationship between the respondents' perceptions of certain concrete, measurable problems (such as infrastructure capacity or exchange rate variability) in the economy and objective measures of those same problems external to the survey. ${ }^{11}$\n\nThe external measures chosen were:\n\n- Exchange rate variability ${ }^{12}$ defined as the standard deviation of the real exchange rate (measured monthly and normalised at the beginning of the period) with the US dollar over the twelve months prior to implementing the survey;\n- Telephone infrastructure ${ }^{13}$ defined as the number of telephone lines per capita (measured in 1997, the latest available year).\n\nThe corresponding survey questions were:\n\n- Rate the overall quality and efficiency of the services delivered by the telephone service (on a scale ranging from 1 - very good to 6 - very bad);\n- How problematic is the exchange rate for the operation and growth of your business? (on a scale ranging from 1 - no obstacle to 4 - major obstacle).\n\nCountry indices of both infrastructure and exchange rate variability were calculated from the mean response to each question and these indices were compared to the external measures. A significant relationship between the internal and external measures is evidence that there is\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ These definitions come from Rosten (1968).\n    ${ }^{11}$ The problem of perception bias has been recognised before. In particular, see Kaufmann and Wei (1999) and Kaufmann and Zoido-Lobatón (1999b). The first of these papers is concerned with controlling the bias at the level of individual respondents, in the context of regression analysis. In that context, any country-level bias can be controlled using country fixed effects (although it cannot then be disentangled from other country effects) and the only issue remaining is to control for unduly optimistic or pessimistic individuals relative to the country effect. This does not require any information external to the survey. What we are concerned with here is precisely the discrimination between country bias and other country effects since the paper is concerned only with cross-country comparisons. For that we require external information. The second paper is concerned with country level bias. The role of the external information that we employ here is filled by the assumption that the foreign firms in any given country provide more objective assessments than their purely domestic counterparts.\n    ${ }^{12}$ Source: EBRD calculations\n    ${ }^{13}$ Source: World Development Report 1999 (and originally International Telecommunication Union)",

It should be borne in mind, however, that there will be other factors which are unaccounted for. In addition, the two survey indices do not correspond perfectly to the external measures. Exchange rate variability may be more or less important to firms in different countries depending on their exposure to international transactions. The number of telephone lines per capita may be only weakly related to the actual quality of service. Finally one must be willing to assume that measurement of the bias on these particular questions carries information about the potential bias on the remaining questions which cannot be corroborated. These caveats should recognised when interpreting the results.\n    ${ }^{16}$ This is intended to be suggestive rather than a precise statistical test.",

The survey succeeded in sampling a wide variety of firms within the constraints imposed by the sample quotas, which lends confidence to the results. Firms varied in a number of characteristics including the geographical location of the firm; state or private ownership; area of main activity; number of employees; internationalisation; major trading partners; control of firm decisions; number of majority shareholders; identify of majority shareholder and the origin of the firm.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{17}$ This is very much a preliminary approach to the issue.

The investment climate: the micro- and macro- dimensions of governance\n\n## Conventions adopted in presenting the results\n\nThis section presents the main results of the survey. For most questions the respondents were asked to choose the most appropriate answer from a linear scale list of up to six choices. For these questions the graphs below illustrate by country the percentage of firms with responses in the two or three extreme categories (depending on the number of choices), and (except for the star charts - see box 5.1 below) the proportion of firms in each of those categories is shown in a different colour.\n\nFor questions with free-responses the means have been reported. For questions in which the categories represented ranges of numerical values, an imputed free variable has been calculated as the midpoint of the category, or the lower endpoint of an open-ended category, and again the mean presented. On each bar chart, an error bar represents the standard error of the sample estimates.\n\nThe convention that has been adopted in reporting the data is as follows:\n\n- if the question concerns a \"good\" (for example, the quality of public services in figure 5.2 below), then larger numbers represent more desirable outcomes and\n- if the question concerns a \"bad\" (for example, corruption in figure 5.6) then larger numbers represent less desirable outcomes.\n\nThe data have not been weighted so the views of small firms carry as much weight as those of their larger counterparts.",
      "20": "# Box 5.1 - Interpretation of star charts \n\nStar charts are useful for summarising the responses to a group of related questions. In the diagrams in this paper, each country is represented by a single star and each axis of the star represents one of the component questions. The length of the axis is proportional to the percentage of firms responding in the stated categories, thus in figure 5.2 below the length of each axis is proportional to the number of firms responding in categories 1, 2 or 3. To fix the scale, a final star represents the theoretical extreme of $100 \\%$ of responses falling in those categories. Such diagrams illustrate two important aspects of the data: Within each country, the shape of the star illustrates the relative importance (measured by the proportion of responding firms) of each of the component issues addressed in the questions. In addition, by comparing the diameters of the stars it is possible to measure the differing importance of the entire group of issues across different countries.\n\n## Institutions and policies - macro dimensions of governance\n\n## The quality of public institutions\n\nThe most direct measurement of the quality of governance is obtained by evaluating the performance of state institutions.

Conventionally, corruption is defined as the abuse of public office for private gain. However, this definition encompasses a range of practices which are differentiated here. This section discusses the macro-dimensions of corruption, by which is meant the impact of various forms of corruption at a national level. The micro-dimensions concerning specific characteristics of corrupt transactions are discussed later.\n\nFor the first time, the survey measures grand corruption which is defined as private payments to public officials to influence the content of the basic rules of the game (i.e. legislation, rules, laws or decrees). As a result of grand corruption, key state institutions can be \"captured\" by private interests to skew the policy-making process in favour of particular firms and render the operation of government non-transparent. The survey also measures patronage and petty corruption of the sort that individuals and firms encounter in their direct dealings with the state.\n\nAttempts to compare the amount of corruption between different countries are fraught with difficulties. Bribery is usually illegal and firms must be expected to be reluctant to admit that they pay bribes. In implementing the survey, the problems associated with collecting reliable data were kept constantly in mind, and every effort was made to assure respondents that their answers would be treated confidentially. Questions were phrased indirectly about the corruption faced by \"firms in your line of business\" and respondents were assured that responses would be aggregated and not attributable to themselves or their firms.",

A composite index of state capture is presented in Figure 5.11, constructed as the average proportion of firms reporting that each of these components of grand corruption is a problem.\n\nThe survey also allows the identification of a group of firms willing to admit to purchasing laws and decrees.

The unwillingness to pay additional taxes to deal with such problems could be interpreted in two ways: these problems are not necessarily imposing substantial costs on firms or the state in question suffers from such low credibility that firms are not willing to agree to any additional taxation regardless of the costs.

Unpredictable changes in government policy or regulations increase risk in the business environment and produce large disincentives for investment. The survey asked firms to assess the predictability of government policies and laws; the results are presented in Figure 5.18.\n\nFigure 5.18:\nHow predictable are changes in the government's economic and financial policies which materially affect your business?\nAnd how predictable are changes in rules, laws or regulations?\n![img-30.jpeg](img-30.jpeg)\n\n## Predictability over time\n\nFirms were also asked whether there has been any change in the unpredictability of government actions over the past three years (Figure 5.19).",

Key issues are again the predictability and transparency with which these control rights are exercised and the resulting costs imposed on firms.\n\n## Information on rules and regulations\n\nAn important component of a transparent and predictable regulatory environment is that information on the rules and regulations by which firms are to be constrained is easily available. Firms were asked how easy it is to obtain such information (Figure 5.24).\n\nFigure 5.24:\nTo what degree do you agree with this statement? \"Information on the laws and regulations affecting my firm is easy to obtain\"\n![img-36.jpeg](img-36.jpeg)",

This section investigates the micro characteristics of the corruption transaction. The dimensions of interest include the frequency and level of bribery (in the sense of the additional tax burden that corruption imposes on firms), uncertainties associated with corruption, the recipients of bribes, the extent of bribery associated with public procurement and the extent to which there is bureaucratic accountability in the provision of public services.",
      "36": "Firms were asked how frequently they face demands for bribes. Since a high frequency of bribery need not be associated with a high level of bribes (or implicit tax rate), this is closer to a measure of how ingrained corrupt practices are within the bureaucracy than a measure of the economic cost imposed by that corruption. Figure 5.30 gives the responses.\n\nFigure 5.30: How often would you say the following statement is true? \"It is common for firms in my line of business to have to pay some irregular 'additional payments' to get things done\".\n![img-41.jpeg](img-41.jpeg)\n\n# Bribes paid \n\nFirms were asked to estimate the additional tax burden, as a proportion of revenues, imposed on them by corruption. This presents one of the most direct measures of corruption in the survey. The question was posed in terms of firm revenues rather than profits since estimates of revenues are more reliable; firms in transition economies frequently face significant incentives to misreport profits.\n\nFirms were only asked to answer this question if they replied that they ever paid bribes in response to the previous question. The proportion of such firms in each country is given in Figure 5.31. Such a response may be regarded as genuine non-payment or an unwillingness to discuss the subject. In any case the results presented in Figure 5.32 should be interpreted as the average additional tax imposed by bribery among those firms admitting to paying bribes.\n\nFigure 5.31:\nProportion of firms admitting to paying bribes\nResponses:\n1 Always\n2 Mostly\n3 Frequently\n4 Sometimes\n5 Seldom\n6 Never\nPercentage of firms reporting that they ever pay bribes\n![img-42.jpeg](img-42.jpeg)",

As a result, corruption is frequently a source of substantial uncertainty for the firm. The survey asked firms about various forms of uncertainty connected with bribery; the responses are presented in Figures 5.33 to 5.35 . Only those firms which stated that they pay bribes frequently or more are included below since such uncertainty is unimportant if the firm only pays bribes infrequently.\n\nFigure 5.33:\n![img-44.jpeg](img-44.jpeg)",

The firms are divided into the following categories:\n\n- New Private: comprising all private firms with no state-owned predecessor\n- Privatised: comprising all private firms which were formerly state owned\n- State Owned: comprising all those firms still in state ownership\n\nIn addition we partition the firms into:\n\n- Small: comprising all firms with fewer than 50 employees\n- Medium: comprising all firms with between 50 and 500 employees\n- Large: comprising all firms with more than 500 employees\n\n\n## Bribes Paid\n\nThere are significant differences in both the frequency and the level of bribes paid by firms in different categories. Across the whole sample bribery is a particularly serious disadvantage for new private firms and constitutes a regressive tax with respect to firm size.

      "1": "# Abstract \n\nImproving electricity access in low-income countries is a challenging problem because of the high costs of grid extension and low demand for grid electricity in rural areas. This study elucidates these constraints by analyzing poor households' willingness-to-pay for different types of electricity access, including lower cost off-grid technologies. The theoretical model illustrates how consumer preferences, operational and capital costs of electricity service delivery, and availability of power supply affect households' decisions to acquire electricity technology. These effects are then assessed empirically by estimating beneficiaries'\nwillingness-to-pay for electricity in three low-income countries that have pockets of households living in extreme poverty—Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Rwanda. Consistent with the theoretical model, the results indicate very low household willingness-to-pay for electricity access, and that willingness-to-pay diminishes as households' income declines. Therefore, the study recommends concentrating in the nearer term on ultra-low-cost decentralized off-grid solar technologies in programs to provide household electricity to the poor in rural areas.\n\nThis paper is a product of the Development Research Group, Development Economics.

      "3": "# 1. Introduction \n\nElectricity is an input for important public services, and improving electricity access in developing countries is a significant goal of the international community. The Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations initiative Sustainable Energy for All (SE4All), for example, call for providing household electricity service to the 1.1 billion hitherto non-electrified people worldwide by 2030. Many of these people live in extreme poverty, making a living on less than $\\$ 1.90$ per person per day. Public investment requirements for this endeavor, however, are very high. For Africa alone, achieving the universal access goal is anticipated to cost no less than 31 billion USD per year (IEA 2017), which is equivalent to 70 percent of the continent's total official development assistance influx (WDI 2018). ${ }^{1}$ The extent to which such costs are justified by anticipated economic and human development effects is unclear and a matter of ongoing debate (Peters and Sievert, 2016, Chaplin et al., 2017, Lenz et al., 2017, and Lee et al., 2019).\n\nThese concerns have spurred a growing interest in how off-grid solutions, such as solar-charged lanterns and small-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) home systems, can improve electricity access in rural areas (World Bank, 2018). These off-grid solar technologies can provide sufficient electricity for improved lighting, access to mass media, some limited use of high-efficiency appliances, and battery charging to households in rural areas at substantially lower costs than the traditional approach to increasing household electricity, expanding the national electricity grid. Off-grid alternatives also are more affordable than small diesel-powered generators historically used to compensate for unreliable grid supplies (Foster and Steinbuks 2009). Households and businesses that live under the grid and cannot afford a grid connection because of e.g., high connection charges (Golumbeanu and Barnes 2013) may also prefer that option.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ These estimates do not account for additional costs of maintaining the grid infrastructure, which likely exacerbate existing deficits faced by poorly functioning utilities in many Sub-Saharan African countries (Trimble et. al., 2016).",
      "4": "At the same time, grid electricity access is an important input for the production of many important public services, which increase households' well-being through improved access to education, health care, public safety, and other services. If the aggregate gains to households from improving these public services are high, subsidized grid electrification to improve community electricity access may be desirable from a social planner's perspective. Additionally, improved electricity access at higher voltages for businesses may increase economic activity and welfare. ${ }^{2}$ Both of these issues are beyond the scope of this paper.\n\nThis paper contributes to this important policy discussion by analyzing the willingness-to-pay (WTP) of poor households in rural areas for different types of electricity access. We first develop a theoretical model to study how consumer preferences, operational and capital costs of electricity service delivery, as well as availability of power supply, affect poor developing country households' decisions to acquire (and thus willingness to pay for) electricity access using different technologies. Non-homothetic consumer preferences allow us to characterize the income effects of choosing different electricity access technologies. Specifically, we show that at low-income levels just above a subsistence threshold, households will find it optimal for their purposes to choose solar lanterns or small solar home systems. For households at higher income levels, costlier grid electricity access is typically optimal. Diesel generation can also be optimal for providing household electricity access if grid electricity is unreliable and the operational costs of running a generator are reasonably low. The model also allows for a theoretical characterization of the value of broader community-level and long-term benefits from electrification that would leave households indifferent between choosing between a grid and offgrid technology, for a given income level.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Especially over the long term, productive use of electricity is limited if individual solar systems are the primary source of electricity supply (Blimpo and Cosgrove-Davies, 2019). Higher voltage electricity from the main grid (or larger-scale mini grids) (along with other types of public capital) is essential for improving the productivity of the agricultural sector (Assunção et al., 2018), emergence of manufacturing firms (Rud, 2012), and structural transformation to service-oriented economies (Perez-Sebastian and Steinbuks, 2017).",
      "5": "We then assess these income effects empirically by estimating beneficiaries' WTP for electricity in three low-income countries with pockets of households living in extreme poverty - Burkina Faso, Senegal, and Rwanda. Using survey data from unelectrified rural areas in each of these three countries collected between 2010 and 2013, we calculate stated WTP for different electricity access technologies, such as a solar lamp, a solar home system, and a grid connection. We then analyze its determinants by regressing stated WTP on the household income level, household characteristics, and other control variables.\n\nWe find that households put a high priority on having electricity and are willing to dedicate more than 10 percent of their monthly expenditures to paying for electricity. Consistent with the theoretical model, we also find that the household WTP increases with household income. A 1 percent increase in households' expenditures increases their WTP for electricity access by around 0.2 percent. Moreover, we see that the WTP increase with households' income is nearly twice as large for grid electricity than for a low-cost off-grid technology, such as a solar lamp.\n\nNonetheless, the overall WTP for electricity access by the rural households covered in the study is low enough that it is not sufficient in itself for covering operational and capital costs of extending on-grid electricity supply to poor rural households over the short- and medium-term. These results suggest concentrating efforts to bring electricity service to very low-income households in rural areas on ultra-lowcost off-grid technologies, such as solar lanterns and solar home systems. This recommendation is consistent with providing service that meets the basic needs of low-income rural households, as shown previously by Samad et al. (2013) and Grimm et al. $(2017,2018)$ in the context of solar home systems and even Pico-PV.\n\nAs noted above, if aggregate gains to households from improving provision of public services are high, subsidized grid electrification to improve community electricity access may be desirable from a social planner's perspective. Estimating indirect effects of grid electrification is beyond the scope of this paper. However, other",
      "6": "studies find them too small to justify the extensive added cost for on-grid electrification (and maintenance of grid infrastructure) in remote poor areas, given the severe fiscal constraints faced by Sub-Saharan African countries (see e.g., Dinkelman 2011, Bernard 2012, Peters and Sievert 2016, Chaplin et al., 2017, Lenz et al., 2017, and Lee et al., 2019). In the longer term, the benefits of on-grid electrification become more desirable as households' incomes and productive opportunities grow due to a range of factors including, e.g., improved market access (Gollin and Rogerson, 2014, Blimpo and Cosgrove-Davies, 2019).\n\nOur paper is part of a small but growing economics literature on demand for electricity access in developing countries. Lee et al. (2019) randomize different household connection fees across villages in Western Kenya to obtain households' revealed WTP for grid access, observing that adoption rates only increase modestly with decreasing fees. They conclude that the benefits people obtain from household electricity access to the grid (as revealed by their WTP) do not justify the high investment costs of expanding grid access, implying that expanding grid access for households might even produce negative social surplus. Blimpo et al. (2018) estimate a model of household and utility behavior, in which households choose their energy source and consumption quantity, and profit-maximizing utilities set connection charges. They similarly find that small willingness to pay for grid electricity access leads to low electrification rates. While these two studies are primarily concerned about grid electricity access, we also provide evidence on differences in the WTP for different types of electricity access technologies.\n\nOur paper also relates to the recent literature on income effects of energy transition in developing countries. Wolfram et al. (2012) document that as poor households' incomes rise, their adoption of energy-using assets typically follows an S-shaped pattern, with the most rapid increases of ownership of energy-intensive appliances above the first threshold income level. Gertler et al. (2016) analyze household decisions to acquire energy-using assets in the presence of rising incomes. Similar to our paper, they develop a theoretical framework to characterize the effect of income",
      "7": "growth on asset purchases and find that household demand for energy-using assets depends on the pace of income growth. Unlike our paper, where income effects of households' willingness to pay for electricity access are driven by non-homothetic preferences, Gertler et al.'s (2016) results are largely driven by credit constraints.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 outlines the theoretical model of demand for electricity access technologies. Section 3 describes the contingent valuation design and the data collected in the three surveyed countries. Section 4 shows the results of econometric analysis including a set of robustness checks. Section 5 concludes.\n\n# 2. Theoretical Model of Electricity Technology Choice \n\nIn this section, we first develop a simple tractable model of households' electricity technology choice. The objective is to show how non-homothetic preferences, operational and capital costs of technology, as well as structural characteristics, such as reliability of power supply, affect poor developing country households' decisions to acquire electricity technology. The salient feature of the model is the assumption that under extreme poverty, electricity use is only feasible after demand for other basic needs is met. When subsistence expenditures are met, the choice of electricity technology and the amount of consumed electricity services depends on standard parameters from the energy economics literature. The model allows us to characterize income effects of choosing between different electricity access technologies and determining the value of societal benefit from indirect effects of grid access that makes households indifferent between choosing between the grid and off-grid technologies for a given income level.\n\n### 2.1. Assumptions\n\nThe economy comprises of representative consumers (households) with income $M$. For simplicity, we assume there are only two consumer goods and services: a subsistence good (food), $f$, and electricity services, $\\bar{e}$. Consumers derive utility from consumption of food and electricity services in the following manner:",
      "8": "$$\nU(f, e)=\\alpha \\ln (f-\\bar{f})+\\tilde{e}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{f}$ is the subsistence level of food, and $\\alpha$ is some positive scaling factor. The quasi-linear utility function guarantees that the subsistence good $f$ is not subject to income effects, reflecting the necessity feature. Another important feature of this preference structure is that households have positive utility from the consumption of the subsistence good even with zero consumption of electricity in this subsistence economy. Food has a constant price, which, for simplicity is normalized to 1 . Following Atkeson and Kehoe (1999), the consumption of electricity services comes from available\ni) electricity access technologies that deliver the quantity of electricity, $e$, with probability $\\pi$, which captures availability of power supply, and\nii) electricity use technologies, $z$, that cost $p_{z}$ (per kW of electric power) and deliver services derived from electricity with the intensity factor $v .{ }^{3}$\n\nThe consumption of electricity services is thus given by\n\n$$\n\\tilde{e}=\\min \\left\\{\\pi e, \\frac{z}{v}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nIt is straightforward from equation (2) that the optimal utilization of electricity use technologies requires $z=v \\pi e$. This is because if $\\pi e>\\frac{z}{v}$, the electricity in excess of $z / v$ is wasted, and if $\\pi e<\\frac{z}{v}$, the electricity-using appliance is left idle. Assuming that households utilize these technologies optimally, we can rewrite equation (2) as\n\n$$\n\\tilde{e}=v \\pi e\n$$\n\nWe consider three electricity access technologies $i$ that are common in many lowincome countries. These technologies have important characteristics, which make the choice of each technology optimal under certain conditions. Technology 1 is a grid\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ For example, the LED light bulb produces lighting services with much lower electricity intensity than the incandescent light bulb.",
      "9": "connection. It has a high capital cost, $k$ (costs of pole installation and wiring), medium operational (unit) cost, $p$ (the tariff a utility charges per kWh ), and medium availability, $\\pi$ (number of incidences and duration of power outages, which are very common in developing countries). Technology 2 is a diesel generator. It has medium capital costs (the acquisition cost of a generator), high operational cost (diesel and maintenance costs), and is always available. ${ }^{4}$ Technology 3 is a solar home system. It has low capital costs (the acquisition cost of the solar home system), zero operational cost (as solar energy is free and maintenance costs are negligible and are thus ignored), and low availability (as the solar light is available only a limited number of hours per day). Additionally, both the diesel generator and the solar home system have limited electricity generation capacity, $\\bar{e}$, and can thus deliver a limited amount of electricity. The solar home system has a particularly small generation capacity that is assumed lower than that of the diesel generator. We assume that the electric power supply from the grid connection is unlimited for household purposes. Table 1 summarizes the intrinsic features of each technology.\n\nTable 1: Characteristics of electricity access technologies\n\n| Technology | Capital | Operational | Availability | Capacity |\n| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n|  | Cost $(\\boldsymbol{k})$ | Cost $(\\boldsymbol{p})$ | $(\\boldsymbol{\\phi})$ | $(\\overline{\\boldsymbol{e}})$ |\n| Grid | High | Medium | Medium | Unlimited |\n| Diesel generator | Medium | High | High | High |\n| Solar home system | Low | Zero | Low | Low/Medium |\n\nIn formal terms these assumptions can be summarized as follows: $k_{1}>k_{2}>k_{3} ; p_{2}>p_{1}>$ $p_{3}=0 ; \\quad \\pi_{3}<\\pi_{1}<\\pi_{2}=1 ; \\quad \\bar{e}_{3}<\\bar{e}_{2}<\\bar{e}_{1}=\\infty, i=\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n\nFor each chosen electricity access option $i=\\{1,2,3\\}$ the household thus faces the following problem:\n\n$$\n\\max _{f, e} U\\left(f, v \\pi_{i} e\\right) \\text {, s.t., }\n$$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ This assumption implies there are no shortages of diesel and spare parts.",
      "10": "$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\lambda: f+k_{i}+\\left(p_{i}+p_{z}\\right) e \\leq M \\\\\n& \\mu_{i}: e \\leq \\bar{e}_{i}, i=2,3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ : are the Lagrange multipliers. Inequality (4) is the standard household budget constraint. Inequality (5) is the electricity availability constraint, which states that the amount of consumed electricity cannot exceed the maximum amount of electricity the technology can produce. As grid electricity supply is unlimited, the electricity availability constraint (1) is always slack for this technology.\n\n# 2.2. The optimal households' choice of electricity access technologies \n\nThe problem can be solved in two stages. We first solve for the optimal consumption of food and electricity (denoted by $f^{*}$ and $e^{*}$, respectively) for each given electricity access technology $i$. We then compare these solutions to determine when each technology is optimal to choose. The consumer will choose the technology $i$ if\n\n$$\nU_{j}\\left(f^{*}, e^{*}\\right)>U_{i \\neq j}\\left(f^{*}, e^{*}\\right) \\forall i, j=\\{1,2,3\\}\n$$\n\nThe first stage derivations are trivial using standard Lagrangian techniques and are shown in the Appendix. The second stage comparisons are described below.\n\nLet us first start with comparing the grid connection versus the diesel generator choice. In doing so, we need to consider two separate subcases: when the capacity of the diesel generator does not bind, and when the capacity of the diesel generator does bind. Below we focus on the former subcase, as even a small diesel generator is typically sufficient to meet the energy needs of a household living in extreme poverty. ${ }^{5}$ The latter subcase is shown in the Appendix. The household prefers the grid connection to the diesel generator (and thus has higher WTP for the grid connection) if\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ The capacity of diesel generators in Sub-Saharan Africa ranges between $0.5-2.5 \\mathrm{~kW}$. This has sufficient capacity to meet consumer demand for basic electric services consumed by poor households, such as e.g., electric lighting, using radio and TV, and charging a mobile phone.",

The second term on the LHS of these inequalities shows the utility change due to residual income effect. The term on the right-hand side of inequalities (7), (8), and (9) illustrates the utility change due to differences in capital costs and capacities.\n\nFinally, observe that if\n\n$$\nM \\leq k_{3}+p_{z} \\bar{e}_{3}+\\bar{f}=M_{0}\n$$\n\nno electricity supply option will be chosen.\n\n# 2.3. The effect of household income changes on their electricity access technology choices \n\nInequalities (7)-(9) allow us to determine how changes in the household's income affect electricity access technology choice. Differentiating the left-hand side of these inequalities with respect to income we see that an increase in the household's income makes it more likely to prefer (thus increasing its WTP for) the grid connection to the diesel generator if\n\n$$\n\\pi_{1}\\left(p_{2}+p_{z}\\right)>p_{1}+p_{z}\n$$\n\nAs the operational cost of diesel generation, $p_{2}$, is assumed to be higher than the cost",
      "12": "of grid electricity, $p_{1}$, this inequality holds as long as the availability of the grid power supply, $\\pi_{1}$ is large enough not to offset the operational cost differentials of the diesel generation and the grid power supply.\n\nSimilarly, we observe that an increase in the household's income makes it prefer the grid connection (or the diesel generator) to the solar home system if the following inequalities hold:\n$M-\\bar{f}>\\frac{\\alpha\\left(p_{1}+p_{2}\\right)}{\\nu \\pi_{1}}+p_{2} \\bar{e}_{3}+k_{3}$,\nfor the grid connection, and\n$M-\\bar{f}>\\frac{\\alpha\\left(p_{2}+p_{2}\\right)}{v}+p_{2} \\bar{e}_{3}+k_{3}$,\nfor the diesel generator. Inequalities (12) and (13) imply that an increase in the household's income at the low-income levels make it prefer the solar home system to the grid connection (or the diesel generator) as this choice renders higher utility gain from the food consumption. The result is reversed when household income becomes high enough. The model thus establishes a relationship between the households' income and the electricity supply technology. Households find it optimal to choose the solar home system when their income is close to subsistence level, and the grid connection (the diesel generator) when their income is large enough and the quality of power grid supply is good (bad).\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the relationship between households' income level and their valuation of electricity access technologies if the operational cost of diesel generation is higher than the cost of grid electricity, and grid supply is reliable. We know from inequality (11) that under these assumptions, households prefer the grid supply to the diesel generator at high-income levels. Panel a) of Figure 1 shows the subcase of households facing grid electricity connection charges that are high relative to the capital cost of the diesel generator, i.e., $k_{1} \\gg k_{2}$. In this subcase, households find it",
      "13": "optimal to acquire a solar home system at the low-income range $M \\in\\left(M_{0}, M_{1}^{*}\\right]$, the diesel generator at the medium income range $M \\in\\left(M_{1}^{*}, M_{2}^{*}\\right]$, and the grid connection at the high-income range $M>M_{2}^{*}$. Panel b) of the Figure 1 shows subcase of households facing electricity connection charges that are close to the capital cost of a diesel generator, i.e., $k_{1} \\geq k_{2}$. In this subcase, households find it optimal to acquire a solar home system at the low-income range $M \\in\\left(M_{0}, M_{1}^{*}\\right]$, and the grid connection at the high-income range $M>M_{1}^{*}$. In this subcase, the diesel generator is never optimally chosen.\n\nFigure 1: Electricity Access Technology Value as a Function of Household Income\na) High grid connection charges\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nNote. Shaded areas represent the break-even social values of electricity grid access vis-a-vis the solar home system (dark-gray area) and the diesel generator (light gray area).\n\n# 2.4. Societal benefits of grid electricity \n\nThe analysis above focuses on decisions of individual households and thus ignores the fact that electricity services are also an essential input to the provision of public goods and services, such as education, health care, and public safety, as well as for improving income generation in the long term. Meeting electricity demand for provision of these public goods is difficult if not impossible with solar home systems and small diesel generators (Lee et al., 2016). Grid electricity access thus yields additional societal benefit and may be socially optimal even if other electricity access",

The break-even value of this benefit (and thus a subsidy for grid electricity access) for the continuum of households with the minimum income level $M_{0}$ is\n\n$$\nE_{1}=\\int_{M_{0}}^{M_{1}^{*}}\\left(U_{3}\\left(f^{*}(M), e^{*}(M)\\right) d M-U_{1}\\left(f^{*}(M), e^{*}(M)\\right) d M\\right)\n$$\n\nif the diesel generator is never optimal at the individual household level and\n\n$$\nE_{2}=\\frac{\\int_{M_{0}}^{M_{1}^{*}}\\left(U_{3}\\left(f^{*}(M), e^{*}(M)\\right) d M-U_{1}\\left(f^{*}(M), e^{*}(M)\\right) d M\\right)+}{\\int_{M_{1}^{*}}^{M_{2}^{*}}\\left(U_{2}\\left(f^{*}(M), e^{*}(M)\\right) d M-U_{1}\\left(f^{*}(M), e^{*}(M)\\right) d M\\right)}\n$$\n\nif both the solar home system and diesel generator are optimal at the individual household level for certain income thresholds. If the realized societal benefit of grid electricity access is higher (lower) than that defined by equations (14) and (15), grid electrification subsidies achieve (do not achieve) welfare improvements.

      "15": "# 3. Empirical Evaluation of Household WTP for Electricity Access \n\nTo empirically test the model predictions, we use unique survey data from rural areas of three representative Sub-Saharan African countries with deep pockets of extreme poverty: Burkina Faso, Rwanda, and Senegal. The data were collected between 2010 and 2013 for impact evaluations on electricity access interventions. All three countries are among the world's poorest countries, classified as \"low-income\" by the World Bank, and had very low rates of electricity access, particularly in ultrapoor rural areas at the time the survey. ${ }^{6}$ The surveyed areas correspond to subcase b) shown in Figure 1 as very few (if any) households in the sample use diesel generation. The analysis thus focuses on the determinants of WTP by rural households for solar generation and grid electricity access.\n\n### 3.1 Data and Quantification of WTP\n\nIdentical WTP questions were asked in all three countries. Table 2 describes the basic information on the collected data sample.\n\nIn Burkina Faso, the data come from an impact evaluation of a Solar Home System electrification intervention in the rural province of Kénédougou supported by the Netherlands' Ministry of Foreign Affairs (see Bensch et al. 2013). For this purpose, a random sample in villages, drawn in 2010, was offered a solar home system (SHS) on a fee-for-service basis. The WTP survey was only elicited among households that did not have any electricity source at the time of the survey. Most of the remaining households had already had a private solar panel bought on local markets. Grid electricity was not available among the surveyed population.\n\nIn Rwanda, the 2011 data are a representative random sample of rural beneficiaries of the nationwide electrification project EARP (Electricity Access Rollout Programme, see Lenz et at., 2017 and Peters et al., 2014). All these households were hence located in rural areas where grid electricity had not yet been available. The\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ According to the World Bank Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) database, rural electricity access in 2013 was $0.8 \\%$ in Burkina-Faso, $7.7 \\%$ in Rwanda, and $27.5 \\%$ in Senegal.",

Results \n\n### 4.1 Households' Stated WTP\n\nFigure 3 presents the WTP of households by country and electricity access technology. We can see that WTP increases in the intensity of electricity access technologies: households are willing to pay the most for the grid access (\\$9.6 to \\$22.3), followed by the small solar home systems (\\$7.1 to \\$15.3), and solar lamp (\\$4.5 to 14.3). In absolute terms, the average household WTP is higher in Senegal",

In fact, households in Rwanda appear to have the highest relative WTP for electricity, willing to spend 14 percent of their total budget. The relative WTP is slightly lower in Senegal (12 percent) and Burkina Faso (10 percent). These results add to the robustness of our estimates, as they correspond to real-world electricity expenditures observed in rural areas (see, e.g., Lenz et al. 2017).\n\n# 4.2 Determinants of household WTP \n\nWe test the predictions of the theoretical model by regressing the households' WTP on households' expenditures. ${ }^{13}$ Table 8 shows the results of the baseline model\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ As we discuss in Section 3.3, households assigned to the grid electricity consumption level are slightly better off. We demonstrate theoretically in Section 2 and show empirically below that higher income levels are indeed associated with higher WTP for grid electricity. One may, therefore, suspect that the substantially higher WTP for grid electricity is driven by these income differences. However, the differences in household WTP are much larger than differences in wealth. For example, average monthly expenditures among the solar lamp group are around 7 percent lower than among the grid electricity group. By contrast, household WTP for solar lamps is 55 percent lower than for grid electricity.\n    ${ }^{13}$ Recognizing the problem of potential measurement error in household expenditures, we also regress the households' WTP on households' asset index calculated based on households' reported ownership of durable appliances. The results reported in the Appendix are very similar.",

In the base model specification, for example, a 1 percent increase in expenditures increases the WTP by around 0.2 percent (column 1). Estimated coefficients for country dummies show that the WTP is the highest in Senegal, followed by Rwanda. The household WTP is the lowest in Burkina Faso (the reference case). This result is consistent with the descriptive analysis in Section 4.1. Also consistent with the descriptive analysis in Section 4.1, the WTP generally increases with higher household electricity consumption levels. Furthermore, we can see that the WTP is clearly affected by the values of the initial starting bid. ${ }^{14}$ The higher this initial bid, the higher the households' WTP. Most of the other household characteristics do not appear to have a clear influence on the estimated WTP (column 2). Only two household characteristics - the educational level of the head of household, and access to finance (measured by the availability of bank account) increase the WTP substantially. We also see that the addition of these controls has a very small effect on the size of the estimated coefficient for household expenditures.

Again, we see that that the wealthier a household, the higher is its WTP for electricity access, and the increase in the WTP is the highest for the wealthiest households.\n\nFinally, we analyze the differential effect of expenditures on household WTP depending on the electricity consumption level by interacting WTP and the different consumption level scenarios (column 4). Consistent with the theoretical model, we see that the WTP increases significantly more with households' income for grid electricity than for a solar lamp. A 1 percent increase in households' expenditures increases their WTP for grid electricity by 0.23 percent. For a solar lamp, it increases only by half of that magnitude ( 0.12 percent). These effects are statistically significantly different.

As households become wealthier, they put greater value on access to the grid, so that they can consume larger and more reliable amounts of electricity. Below we perform a simple cost-benefit analysis to determine whether the estimated magnitude of the difference in WTP for the different electricity access technologies is high enough to cover the difference in investment costs. In doing so, we divide the investment cost of electricity access technologies by the estimated households' monthly willingness to pay and obtain the hypothetical amortization period of the corresponding",
      "26": "technology. ${ }^{15}$\n\nFor solar sources, the calculation is straightforward and intuitive. One could think of a fee-for-service arrangement where households pay for the fixed cost over several months. No additional direct costs occur (abstracting from maintenance costs, which are assumed to be small enough to be neglected) because electricity production is free. For the grid electricity, both the fixed and variable costs have to be borne by the household. Therefore, we add operational costs for a hypothetical consumption of 250 kW per year. ${ }^{16}$ We assume no external cost of finance and thus do not include interest rates and loan service fees in calculations of the amortization period.\n\nTable 9: Amortisation period\n\n| Technology | Approx.

Kearney (2014). Monthly consumption fees assume an average consumption of 250 kWh per year and an electricity tariff of 0.22 USD per kWh . Amortization period is determined by dividing the investment cost of electricity access technologies by the estimated households' monthly willingness to pay.\n\nTable 9 shows that amortization periods vary from 2 months for a solar lamp in Senegal to 219 months for a grid connection in Burkina Faso. In general, amortization periods seem reasonable only for solar lamps if the investment costs had to be entirely financed by the households. The relatively higher WTP for higher household income and consumption levels does not keep pace with the rapidly increasing investment costs of the higher-tier electricity access technologies. As point estimates\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{15}$ An alternative approach would be to calibrate and simulate the model described in section 2. This approach is, however, obscured by the lack of reliable estimates of some of the model's parameters, resulting in a loose calibration problem. We have, nonetheless, tried simulating the model for a range of plausible parameter values, and results were similar to the ones presented in this section.\n    ${ }^{16} 250 \\mathrm{kWh}$ per year is the minimum electricity consumption defined by IEA (2011) for their Universal Access investment cost calculations.",
      "27": "in stated WTP approaches couldn't be obviously taken at face value, this very simple cost-benefit analysis has to be interpreted with some caution. This caveat notwithstanding it is nonetheless plausible to infer from our analysis that off-grid solar powered technologies are more likely to generate positive net private returns.\n\nAs discussed in the theoretical model above, this simple cost-benefit analysis does not account for the positive external effects of the grid access. Therefore, access to grid electricity may still be socially optimal. Given the large gap between costs and individual valuation for grid electricity, these benefits have to be substantial, and certainly exceed the ones found by the limited empirical evidence for the SubSaharan Africa region (Grimm et al., 2017; Lenz et al., 2017, Lee et al., 2019).\n\n# 5. Conclusion \n\nThis paper contributes to the important policy discussion about improving household electricity access in low-income developing countries while keeping it affordable and financially viable. Our empirical findings for three Sub-Saharan African countries suggest that even poor households have a fairly high priority for access to basic electricity services and are willing to dedicate more than 10 percent of their monthly expenditures to electricity. At the same time, high costs of grid extension and low consumption levels of electricity by households in rural areas, especially among the poor, imply a need for highly subsidizing grid electrification as a means for increasing electricity access for rural households.\n\nOur analysis underscores, both theoretically and empirically, the role of households' income as a critical driver for their electricity access decisions. At low-income levels close to subsistence level, households will find it preferable to choose ultra-low-cost electricity access technologies, such as small solar home systems, to meet their own electricity demands. As household incomes grow, grid electricity connection becomes a more attractive choice. Our empirical estimates suggest that a 1 percent increase in households' expenditures increases the WTP for electricity access by around 0.2 percent, and households are about two times as likely to prefer grid",
      "28": "access to the solar lamp at higher income levels.\nThese results suggest that the best strategy for improving household electricity access in low-income countries requires combining short-term rural electrification efforts using ultra-low-cost off-grid technologies with a range of efforts for longer-term poverty reduction including investments in human capital and productive infrastructure. As households escape extreme poverty, income growth increases their WTP for electricity services, and on-grid electrification allows for better development potential in the longer run.\n\n# References \n\nAtkeson, A., and P.

      "1": "# Abstract \n\nThis paper examines the role of firms' government connections, defined by government intervention in the appointments of Chief Executive Officers and the status of state ownership, in determining the severity of financial constraints faced by Chinese firms. In line with the previous literature, the paper demonstrates that investment by non-state firms is highly sensitive to internal cash flows, while no such sensitivity is found for government-owned enterprises. Even within the subset of non-state firms, government connections are associated with substantially less severe financial constraints (less reliance on internal cash flows to fund investment). The paper also finds that large non-state\nfirms with weak government connections are especially financially constrained, due perhaps to the formidable hold that their state rivals have on financial resources after the \"grabbing-the-big-and-letting-go-the-small\" privatization program in China. Firms with governmentappointed Chief Executive Officers also have significantly lower investment intensities, due perhaps to their lower-powered incentives. The empirical results suggest that government connections play an important role in explaining Chinese firms' investment behavior and financing conditions, and provide further evidence on the nature of the misallocation of credit by China's dominant state-owned banks.\n\nThis paper is a product of the Finance and Private Sector Development Team, Development Research Group.

      "3": "# I. Introduction \n\nThe presence of financial constraints and its effects on firms' investment decisions have received intense interest in the corporate finance literature. There is considerable evidence that financing constraints are an impediment to the investment and growth of firms (Hubbard 1998, Stein 2003). While the majority of the research results have been derived from the experience of developed economies that have many institutional similarities, less work has been done to further our knowledge about financial constraints in developing countries that have different institutional structures. Firms in developing countries tend to face more severe financial constraints than those in developed countries, and their owners typically name financial constraints as one of their primary obstacles to investment (Dethier et al. 2011). Moreover, the governments of these countries tend to play a larger role in directing financial resources than in developed countries (Ayyagari et al. 2012).\n\nCredit allocation in China has been characterized by government intervention and has been biased towards state-owned enterprises (Brandt and Li 2003; Huang, 2003: Bai et al. 2006; Li et al. 2008; Cull, Xu and Zhu 2009; Gordon and Li 2011). Insufficient financial support imposes severe difficulties in the development of firms that lack government connections. ${ }^{2}$ We use firm-level data to understand whether and how firms with differential government connections are financially constrained in China and how that affects their investment patterns. We compare not only state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to non-state firms (both foreign and domestic), but also examine whether CEOs' governmental connections explain financial constraints within the subset of non-state firms.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Dollar and Wei (2007) also provide evidence that distorted capital allocation had led to persistent dispersion in returns to capital across sectors and geographic areas. Farrell and Lund (2006) report that by 2006 the private sector had produced more than half of China's GDP but received only $27 \\%$ of total loans.",
      "4": "In order to identify the impact of institutional structures on financial conditions and corporate investment in China, we present a simple illustrative model by adapting the theoretical constructs from Kaplan and Zingales (1997, 2000) and Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (2000) to the Chinese context in which firms are subject to differential costs of external financing depending on their government connections. Given the highly regulated nature of the formal financial system in China, Chinese local and central governments have a fiscal incentive to channel credit to firms that pay taxes, remit profits, and support their economic, social and political initiatives (Gordon and Li, 2009, 2011). These firms include state-owned firms and nonstate firms with strong government connections. To the extent that firms with strong government connections face lower costs of external funds, their investment should be less responsive to internally generated cash flows than firms with weak government connections, for which the availability of internal funds will likely dictate investment patterns. Our model, therefore, points to inter-linkages between government connections, firms' cash flow, and capital investment behavior.\n\nEmploying the World Bank's survey of manufacturing firms in 120 Chinese cities conducted in 2005, our empirical results suggest that on average Chinese firms do face financial constraints in that their investment rates are sensitive to internal cash flows, as has been shown in China using other data sets. In addition we show that their investment is sensitive to access to bank loans, trade credit and the level of unpledged collateralizable assets (henceforth \"UCA\"), all indicators of access to external finance. That the cash flow variable is still significant when we include the external financing variables in the regressions suggests that internal financing is crucial for investment. In short, external finance is not enough to fund all investment",
      "5": "opportunities for the constrained. Bank loans are exhausted quickly by constrained firms, but they do spur some investment.\n\nTo study the effects of government connections on Chinese firms' investment behavior and financing conditions, we consider two forms of government connections: state ownership and the role of government in CEO appointment. A firm is classified as state-owned if it is registered as such based on the level of government shareholding. While state-owned firms have been corporatized and have their own boards of directors, they maintain close ties with their government supervisory entities and owners, and therefore have strong government connections. Firms can also gain and maintain government connections via personnel appointments and personal ties. Specifically, what we refer to as bureaucratic CEOs in our sample are those appointed to their current position by local governments, indicating firm structural and CEO personal ties to those governments. These bureaucratic CEOs could have achieved their positions because the firms under their management are state-owned, or formerly state-owned. Government intervention in CEO appointment therefore also serves as a proxy for firms' government connections in our empirical analysis.\n\nOur results show how government connections play a key role in explaining firm investment behavior in China. In line with previous studies using different samples and covering different time periods (e.g., Chow and Fung 1998, Héricourt and Poncet 2009, Poncet, Steingress, and Vandenbussche 2010, Guariglia, Liu, and Song 2011), investment in state-owned enterprises in our sample remains insensitive to cash flows, despite substantial institutional reforms undertaken by the central government. ${ }^{3}$ Among non-state and foreign firms, the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ With specific respect to the banking sector, non-performing assets were removed from the balance sheets of state-owned banks and placed in asset management companies (Hsu and Wan, 2004). State-owned banks have",
      "6": "coefficients for cash flows are positive and significant, indicating that they are financially constrained. However, foreign firms, perhaps because of their greater access to foreign capital, exhibit smaller sensitivities of investment to cash flows than non-state Chinese firms. Examining the role of government connections via CEO appointments, we find that investment in firms with entrepreneurial CEOs is more sensitive to cash flows than that in firms with bureaucratic CEOs. Additional tests are performed to examine the robustness of these results to various measures of firms' financial conditions. In particular, investment in firms with bureaucratic CEOs also displays substantially less sensitivity to access to finance, access to trade credit, and UCA. Firms with entrepreneurial CEOs often have less access to external finance, but that finance is more closely tied to investment patterns than for firms with bureaucratic CEOs. It appears therefore that firms with entrepreneurial CEOs tend to face tighter financial constraints due, at least in part, to their inferior political status in the Chinese credit market.\n\nAnother prediction from our stylized model is that, although firms with governmentappointed CEOs receive favorable treatment by banks due to their political connections, their investment intensities may be lower than firms with entrepreneurial CEOs. ${ }^{4}$ Bureaucratic CEOs are subject to different promotion criteria and thus might have incentives to maintain stable employment, and use resources that would otherwise be spent on investment to cover firm arrears or seek favors from government officials who have influence over their future career. This implication of our theoretical model is broadly supported by our regression results. Firms with bureaucratic CEOs have lower investment intensities than firms with entrepreneurial CEOs,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    also taken on minority foreign ownership shares, first in smaller banks and later in three of the \"Big Four\" banks. Evidence indicates that minority foreign ownership was associated with gains in efficiency in the smaller stateowned banks (Berger, Hasan, and Zhou, 2009).\n    ${ }^{4}$ We define investment intensity as the ratio of investment in fixed assets relative to lagged capital stock throughout the paper.",
      "7": "and their investments are less sensitive to indicators of growth opportunities. The pattern suggests that the finance received by firms with bureaucratic CEOs (including, or course, SOEs) could be used to cover existing arrears rather than to fund productive investment.\n\nWe also find that investment in non-state, non-government-connected, large Chinese firms is especially sensitive to the availability of internal funds, a result that is robust to several plausible sensitivity checks. This could be due to the especially tight government connections of their rivals, large state-owned enterprises, and their relatively easy access to credit from Chinese banks. Under recent policies, the government privatized small and medium sized state-owned firms, retaining controlling ownership stakes in large SOEs. Another plausible interpretation is that for smaller firms, the need for investment funding is commensurately smaller, and thus it is easier to use informal finance such as funding from friends, relatives or trading partners to meet those needs. For large firms the scale of investment needs is so large that informal finance cannot fully meet it, and thus constraints on access to external finance are more binding. Since larger non-state firms are likely to be important engines for growth, this finding is alarming, and speaks to the severe misallocation of credit in China.\n\nOur paper contributes to a growing literature on the causes and consequences of political connections. Political connections are found to be widespread among firms in developing countries and are important resources for firms in developing countries. ${ }^{5}$ For instance, politically-connected firms have better access to loans (Li et al. 2008, Claessens et al. 2008, Fan et al. 2008), have favorable access to equity markets (Francis et al. 2009, Boubakri et al. 2012), have more confidence in the legal system in transitional countries (Li et al. 2008), enjoy more\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ See Fisman 2001, Johnson and Mitton (2003), Leuz and Oberholzer-Gee (2006), Faccio 2006, Li et al.

Moreover, there is evidence that politically connected firms tend to be less efficient than non-connected firms (Leuz and Oberholzer-Gee 2006, Fan et al. 2007; Boubakri et al. 2008, Faccio 2010). ${ }^{6}$ Relative to politically connected firms in China, politically neutral start-ups experience faster productivity improvement, conditional on survival (Du and Girma 2010). The quality of earnings reports from politically connected firms is significantly poorer than that of similar non-connected companies, and lower quality in earnings reports is associated with a higher cost of debt for the non-politically connected firms (Chaney et al. 2011). Politically-connected firms are also more immune to government regulations (Berkman et al. 2010). Our findings add to the literature in that we find non-politically connected firms in China face stronger financial constraints, which may stem from scarce financial resources flowing to inefficient, but connected firms and therefore reflect resource misallocation. We provide evidence that non-connected, large, non-state firms are especially financially constrained. We also provide evidence of weaker CEO incentives and lower investment intensity for politically-connected firms.\n\nOur paper also fits into a large microeconometric literature that investigates the role of financial factors in corporate investment decisions. The earliest contributions demonstrate that in well developed economies such as the U.S. (e.g. Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen 1988; Almeida, Campello and Weisbach 2004), U.K. (e.g. Bond, Elston, Mairesse, and Mulkay 2003), and Japan (e.g. Hoshi, Kashyap, and Scharfstein 1991), firms face substantial financial constraints. In those studies, a significant correlation between investment and measures of internal funds are attributed to capital market imperfections that give rise to financial constraints. There is also an\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ But political connections have returns, as shown by Cooper et al. (2010) and Calomiris et al. (2010).",
      "9": "emerging literature on financial constraints in China. Our paper confirms some results from that literature in that we also find that Chinese firms face financial constraints, but state-and foreignowned firms tend to face less severe ones (Chow and Fung 1998, 2000; Chen 2008; Herícourt and Poncet 2009; Poncet, Steingress, and Vandenbussche 2010; Guariglia, Liu, and Song 2011). We differ from those studies in that (a) we provide direct tests of how financial constraints vary with CEOs' connections to the state, ${ }^{7}$ (b) we provide a simple model that explicitly shows how government connections could affect investment-cash-flow sensitivity and investment levels, (c) we show that government connections matter for financial constraints and investment within the sub-sample of non-state firms, (d) we provide robust evidence that large non-state firms without government connection tend to be most severely constrained among firms of all sizes, and (e) we use a more representative sample of Chinese firms. ${ }^{8}$ We also differ slightly in terms of methodology in that we look at both investment-cash-flow sensitivity and investment sensitivity to access to external finance.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{7}$ Chan et al. (2011) also examine political connections and financial constraints, and find that connected firms are less constrained. We differ from them in the following ways. First, they use only listed firms, which are large firms that are likely to face the least severe financial constraints. Second, their measure of political connection is whether the CEO/Chairman was a government official, a military officer or someone with a political ranking at the provincial or ministerial level, while ours is whether the CEO was appointed by the government. Thus their measure represents a very specific connection related to provincial level political ranking, while our measure represents government connection at all levels for all types of firms. Third, our sample is more representative, and thus we can examine how the effects of political connections on financial constraints differ across firm sizes. Fourth, we examine how political connections are associated with investment levels and CEO incentives. Fifth, we offer a simple theoretical model that spells out explicitly how government connections affect a firm's investment and investment-cash-flow sensitivity. Finally, we provide a more comprehensive set of robustness checks.\n    ${ }^{8}$ Chow and Fung $(1998,2000)$ use a panel of manufacturing firms operating in Shanghai over the period 19891992. Héricourt and Poncet use data from 1300 firms from 2000 to 2002. Chen (2008) used listed firms, which are largely state-owned (see Wang, Xu and Zhu 2004) and arguably are less financially constrained than typical Chinese firms. Poncet, Steingress, and Vandenbussche (2010) use a sample of 22,300 observations from 15,000 large firms from 1998 to 2005. Those firms had at least 150 employees, US $\\$ 10$ million in annual sales turnover, and/or US $\\$ 20$ million in total assets. Similarly, Guariglia, Liu, and Song (2011) a data set with more firms than ours, but that covers large and medium-sized private firms (and all SOEs), and thus is not suited to assessing the financial constraints of small, young firms, which is a point of emphasis in what follows.",
      "10": "There has been debate within the literature on whether high sensitivities of firms' investment to their cash flows should be interpreted as indicators of financial constraints. The standard identification strategy is based on the pioneering work of Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (henceforth FHP) $(1988,2000)$ who argue that one should be able to gauge the impact of credit frictions on corporate spending by comparing the sensitivity of investment to cash flow across samples of firms. Firms are typically split into sub-samples based on a priori criteria indicating the size of the wedge between the internal and external cost of funds. An implicit assumption underlying these empirical tests is that investment-cash flow sensitivities increase monotonically with the severity of financial constraints. However, Kaplan and Zingales (1997, 2000) provide theoretical reasons why a monotonic relationship between sensitivities and constraints need not hold. They report evidence that firms that paid no dividends (hence classified by FHP (1988) as financially constrained) and that had high investment-cash flow sensitivities did not suffer from financial constraints based on their management's statements of firm liquidity.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the controversy in the literature, and see merit in both sides of the argument depending on the context and sample, we argue that the current Chinese institutional context is especially suitable for applying the FHP (1988) methodology to study financial constraints. ${ }^{9}$ To begin, the criteria by which we classify firms as being financially constrained a priori is based on the known institutional context in China. There is by now a well-established literature demonstrating that government ownership of the dominant banks in China has resulted in privileged access to bank credit, the primary source of external financing in China, for\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ Indeed, the studies of China cited above have used those techniques.",
      "11": "SOEs. ${ }^{10}$ Many of these SOES are chronic loss-makers, resulting in a severe misallocation of credit. In addition, using a smaller sample than we do, Ayyagari, Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2010) find that Chinese firms, state-owned or non-state, that report government help as instrumental in obtaining a bank loan do not show subsequent improvements in growth, reinvestment or productivity, unlike other recipients of bank loans. ${ }^{11}$ By relying on institutions to identify firms facing financial constraints, our study is closest to Hoshi, Kashyap, and Scharfstein (1991) who classify Japanese firms by whether they belong to a business group (keiretsu) and find that group members have lower investment-cash flow sensitivities than other firms.\n\nAnother reason the FHP methodology works well in the Chinese context is that, due to China's underdeveloped capital market (Gordon and Li, 2003), external finance for Chinese firms is largely limited to bank credit, making it easier to understand the trade-offs they make between internal funds and limited sources of external funds. In studies using U.S. data, sample firms tended to be large publicly traded firms. The debate there hinged on whether the lack of dividend payments (the FHP approach) was a more reliable a priori indicator of financial constraints than indicators based on qualitative information in their annual 10-K reports\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ See Brandt and Li 2003; Boyreau-Debray, 2003; Cull and Xu, 2003; Gordon and Li, 2003; Allen, Qian, and Qian, 2005; Boyreau-Debray and Wei, 2005; Bai et al. 2006; Li et al. 2008; Cull, Xu, and Zhu, 2009; and Gordon and Li, 2011.\n    ${ }^{11}$ At first blush, findings from Ayyagari, Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic (ADKM) (2010) on the ineffectiveness of informal finance in spurring firm growth and productivity would appear to contradict those from Allen, Qian, and Qian (AQQ) (2005). However, the positive effects of informal finance on productivity growth and firm investment only emerge in the AQQ study when informal finance is defined to include internal financing. Thus, our findings regarding the high sensitivity of firm investment to internal finance for some firms are in line with those in AQQ. At the same time, our findings are also supportive of those in ADKM in that proxies for use of formal sources of external finance are also strongly associated with investment, especially within the sub-sample of non-state firms. The issue is that, because of the misallocation of credit toward government-owned and government-connected firms, many non-state firms do not receive sufficient bank credit to fund all profitable investment opportunities. This is reflected in the regressions below in the strong positive association between investment and internal cash flows for those non-state firms, even after including proxies for formal sources of external finance.",

In China, bank loans are by far the most important source of external finance, but internal finance exceeds all sources of external finance by a wide margin (Allen, Qian, and Qian, 2005). Thus, comparisons of the sensitivity of investment to internal finance would seem to be especially relevant for China.\n\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II formalizes our hypotheses about the relation between investment cash flow sensitivities, CEOs' government connections, and financial constraints. Section III describes the data and uses our proposed strategy to test for financial constraints in a large sample of firms. Section IV concludes.\n\n# II. The model \n\nTo identify the impact of CEO characteristics on financial conditions and corporate investment in China, we develop a simple theoretical framework (based on Kaplan and Zingales 1997, 2000 and FHP 2000) in which firms are subject to differential costs of external financing depending on their CEOs' connections with the government. ${ }^{12}$\n\n## Assumptions\n\nThere are two dates in the economy: 0 and 1 . At date 0 , a firm has access to a production technology $F(I)$ that generates output (at date 1) from physical investment I. F(I) satisfies standard functional assumptions: $\\mathrm{F}^{\\prime}(\\mathrm{I})>0$ and $\\mathrm{F}^{\\prime \\prime}(\\mathrm{I})<0$. Production only occurs if the CEO exerts effort. The amount of effort required to carry out production is proportional to the size of investment: $\\mathrm{e}=\\ell \\mathrm{I}$. The disutility incurred with expanding effort is $\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{e})=\\theta \\mathrm{e}$.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ See also Weisbach (1995) for evidence that CEOs matter greatly for key corporate decisions.",
      "13": "Let the physical goods in which the firm invests have a price equal to 1 , which is constant across time. Investment can be financed either with internal funds (W) or with external funds (E). Following Kaplan and Zingales (1997), we assume that external financing generates a deadweight cost that is borne by the firm (the so-called wedge between the cost of internal and external funds). We denote this additional cost of raising external funds with the function $\\mathrm{C}(\\mathrm{E}, \\mathrm{g})$, where E is the amount of external funds raised and $\\mathrm{g} \\in(0,1)$ is a measure of the CEO's connection with the government. A greater value of g represents stronger firm structural and CEO personal connections to the government. We also assume that the total cost of raising funds is increasing and convex in the amount of funds raised. ${ }^{13}$\n\nRelative to the quality of their investment opportunities, non-state Chinese firms are likely to be discriminated against compared to state-owned firms. The notion that political status influences credit allocation is deeply rooted in the design of China's financial system (Brandt and Li 2003; Gordon and Li, 2003, 2011). Firms with stronger connections with the government are more likely to pay taxes, and can consequently count on receiving government assistance in times of need and can gain privileged access to finance from the formal financial system. Stronger connections with the government thus increase the chance of government bailout when faced with financial difficulty (Faccio et al. 2006), improve the likelihood of receiving loan guarantees from the government and subsidized loans from state-owned banks (Li et al. 2008), and hence enhance the firm's borrowing capacity by effectively reducing the cost of raising external funds (Boubakri et al. 2012). Thus it is plausible that $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial g}<0$. For simplicity, we assume the following functional form for C :\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{13}$ As explained in Kaplan and Zingales (1997), although the convexity of C with respect to E is a reasonable yet not obvious assumption, it is necessary for the system to be well behaved.",

On one hand, the weaker incentives of bureaucratic CEOs lead to underinvestment in general. On the other hand, raising external funds is less costly to bureaucratic CEOs, which tends to increase investment. As the data show, the effect of weak incentives dominates that of cheaper external funds, and thus investment intensities are lower in firms with government-appointed CEOs than in firms with entrepreneurial CEOs in our sample.\n\nThe effects of the availability of internal funds on investment can be obtained by implicit differentiation of the equation above:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d I}{d W}=\\frac{C_{11}}{C_{11}-F_{11}}\n$$",

In particular, firms with stronger ties to the government, such as state-owned firms or firms with government-appointed CEOs, benefit from favorable treatment by banks and thus exhibit smaller investment cash flow sensitivities. Our model is therefore in line with FHP (1988) and Cleary (1999) in that it provides a rationale for arguing that the sensitivity of investment to internal funds can be used to gauge firms' financing conditions.

In each province, the provincial capital, which is often the most populous city, is automatically covered, and additional cities are selected based on the economic size of a province. One hundred firms were sampled in each city, except for the four mega cities (Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and Chongqing) where 200 firms were selected. Within the top 10 industries in terms of value added in each city, firms were randomly selected, including large, medium-sized, and small firms. Our sample is thus quite representative of China as a whole, and of firms of various sizes. This is a key advantage when compared to other studies of financial constraints in China since external validity about the existence of financial constraints depends on the representativeness of the sample.

UCA is measured as the value of fixed assets minus total loans and then divided by the lagged value of fixed assets. ${ }^{15}$ UCA is therefore a measure of access rather than usage of external credit because it summarizes assets that could be pledged in order to obtain future loans.\n\nIn the regression equation, CF denotes cash flows, measured as the summation of net income, interest payments, financing charges, and tax payable. ${ }^{16} \\mathrm{~S}$ denotes sales. For growth opportunities, G, we use two variables: lagged sales growth of the firm, and industry level\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ We do not have a long enough panel to construct a more rigorous measure of capital stock such as through using the perpetual inventory method.\n    ${ }^{15}$ We do not have data on total loans, which are instead proxied by interest payments divided by the average interest rate for loans with maturities between one and three years.\n    ${ }^{16}$ We have also tried the same measure but excluding tax payable. The two proxies have a correlation coefficient of 0.999 , so it is no surprise that the results are similar using either measure.",
      "19": "Tobin's Q. ${ }^{17}$ Since many of the firms in our sample are not publicly traded, we do not have sufficient information to compute firm-level Tobin's Q ratios. We therefore rely on data from all listed firms in China to compute an industry-level average Tobin's Q using the value-weighted formula. ${ }^{18}$\n\nWhen firms are financially constrained, an increase in cash flows, which is assumed to convey no additional information about firms' investment opportunities, would be associated with a rise in investment spending. We therefore expect a positive coefficient for the cash flow variable in this regression model if firms' investment is influenced by their availability of internal funds. In addition to the sensitivity of investment to cash flows, we also include access to bank loans, trade credit and UCA as indicators of access to external finance. We view this as an informative additional check on the relative severity of financial constraints, to the extent that investment remains relatively more sensitive to internal cash flows for firms with weaker connections to the government when these variables are included in the regression.\n\nSince some $X$, all F , and lagged sales growth rates are available for only one year, we use the cross sectional estimation method in our base specification. For CF, Tobin's Q, and sales intensity, we have two years of data, and so we also present fixed effects specifications in models with fewer variables than in the base specification. In those models, we are relying on withinfirm differences to identify the effects of cash flows and Tobin's Q on investment.

      "20": "intensity, CF, and sales growth. We therefore winsorize the observations using a 1 percent tail wherever appropriate to reduce the influence of those outliers. ${ }^{19}$\n\n# Summary statistics and patterns \n\nTable 1 reports summary statistics for the full sample. We define firms' ownership type based on the response to the corresponding question in the questionnaire. If the answer to the ownership type question is \"state\", the firm is categorized as state-owned; if the answer is \"foreign\" or \"Hong Kong SAR, China; Macao; and Taiwan, China,\" the firm is categorized as foreign; if the answer is corporation, collective, or private, the firm is categorized as non-state in our sample. The majority ( 78 percent) of our sample is non-state firms, while foreign-owned firms account for 12 percent.\n\nThe average age of firms is 13.6 years. On average, 60 percent of firms had bank loans, while the share of inputs purchased through supplier credit was about 9 percent. The average ratio of sales to lagged capital stock is 6.6 , and the average once-lagged sales growth rate is 53 percent. The high level of sales growth is partly accounted for by observations in the tail of the distribution. The median lagged sales growth is much lower at 22 percent.\n\nAccording to Table 2, relative to those with entrepreneurial CEOs, firms with government-appointed CEOs have lower average investment intensities ( 0.18 versus 0.36 ), are much older ( 26 versus 12 years old), are much more likely to be state-owned ( 45 percent versus\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{19}$ This is important since otherwise a handful of observations could drive our results. For instance, while the trimmed $\\mathrm{CF} / \\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{f} 1}$ has a mean of 0.34 (with a standard deviation of 0.88 ), the 99th percentile for the two years of data is more than 15 .",
      "21": "5 percent), and have lower sales over lagged capital stock ( 3.56 versus 7.03), lower cash flow over lagged capital stock ( 0.36 versus 0.64 ), and lower sales growth ( 33 percent versus 56 percent). Firms with government-appointed CEOs are therefore less profitable and growing more slowly. However, in terms of loan access or the usage of trade credit, these two types of firms are similar. The same patterns also emerge within the sub-sample of non-state domestic firms (Table 2). The descriptive patterns are consistent with our model prediction that bureaucratic firms tend to have lower investment intensities.\n\nTable 3 showcases differences in firm characteristics by size. We classify firms into three size categories: small (i.e., those in the bottom quartile in capital stock), medium (those in the middle two quartiles), and large (those in the top quartile). Small firms have significantly higher investment intensities ( 0.53 compared with 0.30 for medium and 0.24 for large firms), but have much worse access to finance on almost all indicators. Yet they also have the highest sales to capital ratios ( 14.7 compared with 4.6 for medium and 2.8 for large firms), the highest cash flow to capital ratios ( 1.11 compared with 0.51 and 0.34 ), and the highest sales growth rates ( 64 percent compared with 51 and 48 percent). The same patterns are evident within the subset of non-state domestic firms. The data therefore suggest that small firms, which are high growth firms, are likely to face relatively severe financial constraints.\n\n# Investment equation based on the pooled sample \n\nSince investment intensity is left censored at zero, a useful starting point would be the Tobit specification. However, since we are primarily interested in marginal effects of the cash flow and finance variables, Angrist (2001) suggests that it is equally appropriate to rely on a linear specification for ease in interpreting results. We therefore mainly focus on linear",
      "22": "regressions in our empirical tests. The qualitative results of the Tobit and linear regressions are very similar.\n\nColumns (1) and (2) in Table 4 show Tobit and OLS results without controlling for growth opportunities or proxies for access to external finance. Columns (3) and (4) add the external financing variables. Column (5) then adds the industry dummies to control for industryspecific growth opportunities, while column (6) provides an instrumental variables regression that treats the cash flow variable as being endogenous. In Column (7), we add lagged sales growth and industry average Tobin's Q (but without the industry dummies), and column (8) reports the fixed-effects results. Since the qualitative results for our key variables are very similar for the Tobit, IV, and OLS results, we rely on OLS and FE from this section forward.\n\nControlling for growth opportunities does not alter our key results. This is reassuring since one argument against the interpretation of coefficients of cash flows as indicators of financing constraints is that they are also a proxy for investment opportunities. The effects of growth opportunities are of the expected signs: positive and significant, in both OLS and FE results.\n\nOur proxies for access to finance are strongly correlated with investment in our sample. Increasing access to bank loans by one standard deviation ( $\\sigma$ ) would increase investment intensity by roughly 0.075 , which translates into 0.085 of the standard deviation for the investment intensity variable. Usage of trade credit is also significantly associated with investment, consistent with the literature that finds that trade credit has played a positive role in China's development given its poor financial infrastructure (Allen, Qian, Qian 2005; Cull, Xu",
      "23": "and Zhu 2009). ${ }^{20}$ Increasing trade credit by one $\\sigma(0.195)$ would increase investment intensity by 0.015 . The effects of formal finance through the banking system are therefore five times as large as those of informal trade financing arrangements. The availability of collateralizable assets (UCA) is also positively associated with investment. Increasing UCA by one $\\sigma$ (1.64) would increase investment intensity by 0.05 .\n\nMost importantly for our analysis, normalized cash flow is significantly and robustly associated with investment in our sample. Increasing it by one $\\sigma(1.43)$ would increase investment intensity by 0.15 . For other control variables, notable findings are that non-state firms tend to have higher investment intensities, and that younger firms tend to invest more. Those findings are consistent with the notion that young non-state firms have higher growth opportunities, as was suggested by the summary statistics.\n\nSome of the recent papers on financial constraints in China have employed estimation methods that deal with the potential endogeneity of the cash flow variable. We follow Poncet, Steingress, and Vandenbussche (2010) using lagged values of cash flows as instruments for current cash flows. Because we have information on cash flows for only the year of the survey and two years prior, and because the cash flow variable is deflated by lagged capital stock by construction, we are able to use only a single lag of the cash flow variable in the IV regression in column (6). In the first stage, the instrument is highly statistically significant, with a t-statistic of 14.5, and thus satisfies the relevancy criterion for a good instrument. It is questionable whether the lagged cash flow satisfies the validity criterion, that is, is not correlated with the error\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{20}$ The importance of trade credit for explaining firm performance in general and African firm performance in particular is also observed in cross country firm samples (Harrison, Lin and Xu 2011).",
      "24": "directly, and thus the IV results should be viewed only as a sensitivity check. ${ }^{21}$ As noted, because the IV results are very similar to the OLS and FE regressions with regard to the effects of cash flows and external sources of finance on investment, we do not present IV results in the robustness checks that follow. ${ }^{22}$\n\nTo summarize, the results based on the pooled sample suggest that on average Chinese firms do face financial constraints-their investment rates are sensitive to cash flows, but also to access to bank finance and trade credit, and to the availability of collateralizable assets.\n\n# Robustness checks for the base specification \n\nBecause our regressions are cross-sectional, omitted variables that are correlated with our key variables may be driving our main results. Table 5 therefore is designed to shed light on the sensitivity of the estimates for our key coefficients to the inclusion of potentially relevant omitted variables.\n\nFirst, the level of infrastructure in the region where a firm operates may determine its investment intensity, access to finance and cash flows. ${ }^{23}$ For instance, good infrastructure boosts the extent of the market and can lower input costs, which therefore encourages investment. Anticipating higher returns associated with better infrastructure, banks and suppliers could be more willing to supply credit to firms operating in regions with better infrastructure. In column (2) of Table 5, we therefore control for three proxies of the quality of local infrastructure that come directly from our data: the firm's loss of sales due to electricity, due to transport problems (such as breakage and theft), and graded road density for the city (i.e., kilometers of graded roads\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{21}$ When the error term is significantly auto-correlated, for instance, the IV would be invalid.\n    ${ }^{22}$ The IV results are, however, available from the authors.\n    ${ }^{23}$ See Xu (2011) for a survey of some recent evidence on how infrastructure affects firm performance in developing countries.",
      "25": "per thousand city residents). Table 5 shows that the estimates of our key parameters remain largely unchanged after the inclusion of local infrastructure variables. For instance, the coefficient for cash flow over capital was 0.107 in the base specifications and is now 0.106 , both significant at the 1 percent level. Our financial constraints results therefore are unlikely to be attributable to regional variations in the underlying quality of infrastructure.\n\nSecond, due to varying degrees of state ownership or past state involvement within privatized firms, they likely differ in their autonomy over investment. Investment autonomy has the potential to explain both financing and cash flow variables and thus investment intensity. In column (3) of Table 5, we therefore add an index of autonomy in investment. This variable, which is also available from the survey, measures the degree of managerial control over investment, which varies from 0 to 100 , with 0 meaning no control, and 100 meaning full control. Again, all key parameters are very similar to our base results. One minor exception is trade credit, whose coefficient changes from 0.079 to 0.089 , but it remains statistically significant at the same level. Thus our results on financial constraints are unlikely to be attributable to inter-firm differences in investment autonomy.\n\nThird, managerial human capital has become an increasingly popular explanation for firm behavior and performance (see, for instance, Bruhn, Karlan and Schoar 2010). Since it is certainly plausible that CEOs with stronger incentives and qualifications tend to have higher investment rates and better access to finance, omitting variables that summarize managerial human capital could overstate the contribution of financing variables. In column (4) of Table 5, we control for many CEO characteristics, including years of schooling, whether the CEO was appointed by the government, whether the firm has a board of directors, the ratio of CEO pay to that of the typical worker at the firm, and whether there are explicit incentive provisions in the",
      "26": "CEO's contract. Including CEO characteristics does reduce the magnitude of some financing variables, but only slightly: for example, the coefficient for access to loans drops from 0.155 to 0.140 , and that of trade credit from 0.079 to 0.073 . The coefficients related to external finance and cash flows are generally very similar, however. Thus our conclusions about financial constraints are not overturned by the inclusion of CEO characteristics in our regressions.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out that CEO schooling and the existence of a board of directors are significantly positively related with the level of investment, while government intervention in CEO appointment tends to decrease investment. The negative association between investment and government intervention in CEO appointment lends support to our model implication that, although government connections mitigate financing constraints, incentive problems may reduce investment intensities in firms with bureaucratic CEOs.\n\nFourth, institutions have been argued to be important determinants of both national and firm performance (North 1990; Knack and Keefer 1995; La Porta et al. 1997, 1998, 2000; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001, Harrison, Lin and Xu 2011). The impact of institutions is so pervasive that we can easily imagine their quality determining both access to finance (La Porta and others 1997, 1998, 2000) and investment (Knack and Keefer 1995). To control for this possibility, we include the CEO's perception of whether local government officials facilitate firm development (government help) and the likelihood that a firm's property rights will be protected by the legal system in commercial disputes. In addition, we include \"entertainment and travel cost expenses\" (ETC) in our regression to tease out the potential influence of corruption. ETC covers entertainment (including eating, drinking, gifts, karaoke, and sports club membership) and travel expenditures. Besides legitimate business travel and other expenses, Chinese managers commonly use the ETC accounting category to reimburse expenditures used to bribe",
      "27": "government officials, to entertain clients and suppliers, or to accommodate managerial excess. ETC is a standard expenditure item publicly reported in accounting books of Chinese firms, and we use it as a measure of corruption in Chinese firms, as justified by Cai, Fang and Xu (2011). The results are reported in column (5) of Table 5. Again, our key coefficients remain stable after controlling for proxies for institutional frictions, though admittedly none of those proxies are themselves significant.\n\nThe strongest test of omitted variable bias is to include all of these groups of variables in the same regression, as we do in the last column of Table 5. Our key results regarding cash flows and external financing remain robust. The coefficients are very similar to column (1) where we do not control for any of these additional variables, indicating that our regression results on the effects of liquidity constraints are not an artifact of the omission of potentially pertinent variables.\n\nAnother potentially useful robustness test is to examine whether our results regarding financial constraints hold if we estimate the investment equation separately for each industry (see Appendix, Table A3). Allowing industry-specific investment equations has the advantage of holding technology constant and therefore reducing the scope for omitted variable bias. Most of the results on cash flow and access to external finance continue to hold. For instance, in seven of the eight industries, ${ }^{24}$ the coefficient for cash flow over lagged capital is positive and significant. In all eight industries, the coefficient for access to bank loans is positive and significant. The\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{24}$ We study the following eight industries. Industry 1 includes agricultural processing, wood processing, furniture, paper, food, drink, tobacco, educational and sports goods, craft, and printing. Industry 2 includes textiles, cloth shoes and hats, and leather. Industry 3 includes petroleum, chemical fiber, chemical materials, rubber, and plastic. Industry 4 represents general equipment. Industry 5 includes communication equipment and electronics. Industry 6 includes specialized equipment, instruments, medical equipment, and transportation equipment. Industry 7 includes metal, non-ferrous metals, and ferrous metals. Industry 8 includes non-metal manufacturing.",
      "28": "coefficient for UCA is also generally significant. Trade credit is an exception, in that it becomes generally insignificant. This suggests that the positive correlation between trade credit and investment intensity in our base results largely stems from variation across industries. Overall, the industry-specific investment equation estimations are reassuringly supportive of the base results in Table 4.\n\n# Using liquidity classifications to check the effects of financial constraints \n\nAs acknowledged by Fazzari, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988) and Hoshi, Kashyap and Scharfstein (1991), the standard criticism of using the investment-cash-flow sensitivity analysis to examine the effects of liquidity constraints is that liquidity variables also reflect unobserved investment opportunities. Since it is generally difficult to find convincing instrumental variables for liquidity variables in the investment equation, they propose classifying firms into various subsets based on a priori beliefs about the relative severity of information and liquidity problems faced by firms, and then checking whether the cash flow sensitivity is indeed larger for firms classified as facing greater information/liquidity problems. As described above, we classify firms based on their degree of state ownership (institutionalized connections) and whether the CEO was appointed by the government (CEO personal connections). We hypothesize that firms with close connections to the government have easier access to external financing, weaker incentives to be profitable, and lower investment-cash-flow sensitivities.\n\n## Firm ownership\n\nWe estimate Equation (1) for three ownership groups: state-owned enterprises (SOEs hereafter), non-state domestic firms, and foreign firms. Ex ante we expect non-state domestic firms to face more severe financial constraints due to their lack of institutionalized government",
      "29": "connections, and the discrimination of the state-owned banking system against non-state firms in China (Brandt and Li 2003; Cull, Xu and Zhu 2009). The results are reported in Table 6.\n\nConsistent with the literature, we find that SOEs' investment is not sensitive to cash flows. The estimate of the coefficient for the cash flow over lagged capital variable is insignificant for the OLS specification, and even negative for the fixed-effects specification. This pattern is consistent with our conjecture that SOEs benefit from favorable treatment by banks and have greater access to finance. For non-state domestic and foreign firms, the estimates of the coefficient for the cash flows variable are positive and significant for OLS, though the coefficient for non-state firms is larger. In the fixed-effect specification, the cash flow variable has a significant effect on investment only for non-state firms. Both the OLS and the fixed effect specifications therefore indicate that non-state domestic firms are more financially constrained than foreign firms. This is consistent with our priors that foreign firms, because of greater access to foreign capital, should exhibit smaller sensitivities of investment to cash flows than non-state Chinese firms.\n\nIt is worthwhile to point out that investment in foreign firms is more closely correlated with their access to loans. This could be due to a peculiar institutional friction caused by local authorities' competition for foreign direct investment (FDI). In an effort to attract foreign firms to a location, local governments in China often offer loans as matching funds for FDI entry (Huang 2003), and access to those loans may translate into more investment by foreign firms than domestic ones.",
      "30": "# CEOs' government connections \n\nOne of the central predictions of our theory is that firms with strong government connections face smaller costs of external funds, and their investments are therefore less responsive to internally generated cash flows than firms with weak government connections, for which internal funds may be the only way to finance investment. We test this implication by estimating the investment equation separately for firms with bureaucratic CEOs and those with entrepreneurial CEOs (Table 7).\n\nThe estimate of the cash flow coefficient for firms with entrepreneurial CEOs is more than double than that for firms with bureaucratic CEOs in the OLS specification, and about 50 percent larger in the fixed effect specification. Moreover, the estimated coefficient is only significant for firms with entrepreneurial CEOs in the OLS specifications. Investment in firms with entrepreneurial CEOs is also much more sensitive to access to loans, access to trade credit, and UCA. Though firms with government appointed CEOs receive as much external finance as those with entrepreneurial CEOs (Table 2), that finance does not appear to spur investment. ${ }^{25}$\n\nBureaucratic CEOs are subject to different reward systems and may have the tendency to use resources that would otherwise be spent on investment to seek favors from government officials who have influence over their future career. This notion is broadly supported by the data. Table 8 shows that the sensitivity of CEO pay to firm performance and the percentage increase in CEO income if a firm surpasses its performance target are both higher for entrepreneurial CEOs than bureaucratic ones. As a result, and as indicated in Table 2, firms with bureaucratic CEOs have lower investment intensities than firms with entrepreneurial CEOs.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{25}$ Cull, Xu and Zhu (2011) suggest that the leakage of loans to SOEs to trade credit is a possibility.",
      "31": "Furthermore, the OLS results in Table 7 show that the investment of firms with bureaucratic CEOs is less sensitive to indicators of growth opportunities than those of firms with entrepreneurial CEOs.\n\nThese pieces of evidence support the liquidity constraint hypothesis: firms facing better growth opportunities and stronger incentives, that is, firms with entrepreneurial CEOs, are more financially constrained, and they readily translate greater access to internal and external finance into investment.\n\n# Additional checks: Firm size \n\nTo this point, we have shown evidence that financial constraints are more severe for firms in the non-state sector, especially those that lack strong ties to the government. Within that set of firms, we next investigate whether constraints are more severe for some than others. We focus on firm size. In the literature small firms are presumed to have less access to finance because they lack collateral and credit histories, making it difficult for banks to assess their creditworthiness (Berger and Udell, 2006; Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Martinez Peria, 2011). In China, weaker connections with government could put small firms in an even more disadvantageous situation when obtaining external funds.\n\nWe classify firms into 3 groups based on their capital stock in 2003, one year prior to the survey. The bottom, middle two, and top quartiles are defined as small, medium-sized, and large firms respectively. Surprisingly, it is the large non-state domestic firms that show the highest sensitivity of investment to cash flows (Table 9). The cash flow coefficient for large non-state firms is 2.5 times that for small firms. While somewhat surprising in an international context,",
      "32": "since in most countries small firms tend to be most financially constrained, the results in China are plausible. ${ }^{26}$ Non-state firms that grow to be large despite poor access to finance and other obstacles tend to be especially well-run. In particular, large non-state firms are also likely to face especially strong competition, since the ownership restructuring program in the decade around 2000 was guided by the principle of \"grabbing the big and letting go the small\", which essentially privatized almost all small- and medium-sized enterprises, and non-profitable large enterprise, and kept large, profitable enterprises as state-owned (Zhu 1999; Lin and Zhu 2001; Xu, Zhu and Lin 2005). Those large non-state firms competing with the most profitable SOEs likely face the toughest market tests. Their main rivals, large SOEs, also hold sway over government regulations, partly due to their strong connection to the government (Berkman et al. 2010). Indeed, the top large SOEs tend to be ministerial-level appointments within the Communist Party apparatus, and their CEOs have a unique red phone that can directly dial up top government officials, unlike other SOE CEOs (McGregor 2010). Their large SOE rivals also have better access to bank loans, as the state-owned banks show strong bias in favor of SOEs in their lending (Boyreau-Debray, 2003; Cull and Xu, 2003; Gordon and Li, 2003; Allen, Qian, and Qian, 2005; Boyreau-Debray and Wei, 2005; Cull, Xu, and Zhu, 2009; and Gordon and Li, 2011). Adding to the difficulties of large non-state firms in access to external finance is the fact that the equity market in China also strongly favors SOEs (Wang, Xu and Zhu 2004; Francis et al. 2009). Large non-state firms thus have to be especially well run to survive in such fierce markets. Finally, for smaller firms, the need for investment funding is commensurately smaller, and thus it is easier to use informal finance such as funding from friends, relatives or trading partners to meet those needs. For large firms, the scale of investment needs is so large that\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{26}$ On the relative severity of financial constraints for small firms in other countries see, for example, Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2005).",
      "33": "informal finance cannot fully meet it, and thus constraints on access to external finance are more binding. It is thus not surprising that they have higher return from investing their internal funds than other firms. Combining their strong capacity, the relative difficulty of relying on informal finance to meet investment needs, and their lack of access to finance due to government bias, it is plausible that those large non-state firms face especially strong financial constraints, and our finding of larger investment-cash-flow sensitivities for large non-state firms versus SMEs is thus not implausible. Since larger non-state firms are likely to be important engines for growth, this finding is alarming, and speaks to the severe misallocation of credit in China.\n\nRegarding external finance, the patterns for the three groups are broadly consistent with the stylized facts drawn from Table 3. Smaller firms have worse access to finance. For small, medium-sized and large firms, the shares of firms with access to bank loans are 37, 61 and 79, respectively; the average shares of inputs purchased with trade credit are $7.6,8.2$, and 10.6 percent, respectively; and the share of unpledged collateralizable asset is 2,10 and 21 percent, respectively. In the regressions, the coefficients for proxies for access to external finance are more pronounced for small firms than for medium-sized and large firms. For example, for small, medium-sized and large firms, the coefficients for access to bank loans are $0.31,0.17$, and 0.05 (not statistically significant), respectively. This pattern could indicate that, although relatively few small firms receive external finance, those that do are especially strong performers and especially likely to use those funds to invest in the growth of their businesses.\n\nSince the finding of much stronger financial constraints for large non-state entrepreneurial firms may run counter to many readers' priors, we conduct several additional checks. First, we clarify whether the result of greater financial constraints for large firms holds only for entrepreneurial CEOs. In table 10, we re-run the results separately for bureaucratic",
      "34": "CEOs and entrepreneurial CEOs. Since in this paper we argue that government connections provide a key reason for (less severe) financial constraints, our prior is that the degree of financial constraint should not matter much for bureaucratic CEOs, regardless of their size they all have good connections and therefore good access to finance—and that the degree of financial constraint should differ by size for firms without government connections (i.e., entrepreneurial CEOs). The results confirm our priors. The coefficient for the cash flow variable tends to be small and insignificant for firms with bureaucratic CEOs. However, for firms with entrepreneurial CEOs, the cash flow coefficient increases monotonically from 0.10 to 0.16 to 0.28 for small, medium and large firms. It is thus large non-state firms without government connections that suffer most in terms of financial constraints. Large non-state firms with government connections do not suffer much with respect to financial constraints.\n\nSecond, we check whether the stronger investment-cash-flow sensitivity for large nonstate entrepreneurial firms is a mere artifact of the correlation between cash flow and growth opportunities, the classical concern in this literature. In other words, it is possible that the larger magnitude for the cash flow coefficient for these firms merely reflects greater growth opportunities and the stronger correlation between cash flow and growth opportunities. Since growth opportunities are partially unobserved and in the error term, in principle this stronger correlation is impossible to test. However, Altonji et al. (2005) suggest a useful way to detect the seriousness of the bias of the key (potentially endogenous) variable by checking the extent to which that variable is correlated with the observable components of the unobservable growth opportunities. To the extent that observable components are not strongly correlated with the key endogenous variable, or do not alter the coefficient of the key variable much, we have greater confidence in the estimate. Here, we have two observable components of growth opportunities,",
      "35": "lagged sales growth of the firm, and the average industry Tobin's Q. If the larger investment-cash-flow sensitivity for large non-state entrepreneurial firms merely reflects omitted growth opportunities, we would expect a stronger correlation between cash flows and those two variables. In Table 11, we regress cash flow on the two proxies of growth opportunities, along with their interaction with the medium and large size dummies. The results indicate that cash flow is not strongly associated with growth opportunities among large firms. This piece of evidence thus does not support an explanation for the large investment-cash-flow sensitivity for large non-state entrepreneurial firms based on spurious correlation.\n\nThird, Table 12 offers further checks. For each size category, we offer four sets of results: (i) the same as the base specification without the two proxies of growth opportunities; (ii) the base specification with the proxies added; (iii) the instrumental variable estimate with cash flow treated as endogenous and instrumented by its lagged counterpart; (iv) the base specification with more controls for the business environment and CEO characteristics, similar to in Table 5. The results indicate that our finding of significantly greater financial constraints for large non-state entrepreneurial firms is robust. Indeed, controlling for growth opportunities makes little difference on the coefficient ( 0.275 vs 0.280 ). Adding controls reduces the magnitude just by a little (from 0.28 to 0.25 ). Finally, the IV estimate is especially large for large firms, much larger than for the other size groups ( 0.48 for large, 0.22 for medium, and 0.05 for small).",
      "36": "# IV. Conclusion \n\nIn this paper we investigate the analytical and empirical linkages between firms' government connections, capital investment behavior, and financial frictions. In the theoretical framework we specifically concentrate on the role of CEOs' ties to government on firms' investment spending in the presence of financial constraints. Employing a large and representative firm-level data set, we use government appointment of CEOs and state ownership as proxies for firms' government connections, and empirically test whether those connections influence firms' investment and financing conditions. We also examine whether the degree of financial constraints differs across firms of various sizes.\n\nOur empirical findings are consistent with our model prediction that investment in firms with strong government connections is less sensitive to internal cash flows than investment in other firms. In particular, compared to firms with entrepreneurial CEOs, investment in firms with bureaucratic CEOs displays much lower sensitivities to cash flows. This indicates that firms with entrepreneurial CEOs tend to face tighter financial constraints due to their inferior political status in the Chinese credit market. Similarly, and consistent with previous literature using less representative data sets, investment-cash-flow sensitivities are much higher for non-state domestic firms than for other firms. For state-owned firms, which tend to have better access to external finance, there is not a significant link between cash flows and investment. The CEOs of firms with strong connections to the government are subject to different promotion criteria and thus may tend to maintain stable employment and use resources that would otherwise be spent on investment to seek favors from government officials who have influence over their future career. Consistent with that notion, we also find that investment by firms with strong government",
      "37": "connections is less sensitive to access to external finance and to indicators of growth opportunities.\n\nFinally, we find that regardless of their size, investment by non-state Chinese firms is influenced by the availability of internal funds. Financial constraints as reflected in high investment-cash-flow sensitivities appear to be especially severe for large non-state firms without government connection. We conjecture that this may be explained by the greater financial needs of those firms, the relative incapacity of informal finance to cover these financing needs, and the substantial advantages enjoyed by their main competitive rivals (i.e., large SOEs) in gaining access to credit via equity markets and state-owned banks. Our robustness checks confirm this somewhat surprising result.\n\nOur findings are unique in light of previous studies, which have not emphasized how CEO characteristics and political connections affect financing conditions in China, especially within the subset of privately-owned firms. And our findings suggest that large, non-state, nonconnected firms may be especially financially constrained. The result implies that the Chinese credit market is still strongly driven by political connections, and models that ignore firms' CEO government connections are likely to yield imprecise or even misleading estimates of the effects of cash flows on Chinese investment patterns. Moreover, given rising Chinese wages and the potential for low-cost manufacturing to shift to other low-wage, fast-growing countries such as Vietnam and even some in Africa, the role played by large non-state firms is likely to increase over time. How to support the growth of these high-potential firms via improved access to finance therefore should be a key challenge for China in the coming years.",

      "1": "# Abstract \n\nThe aim of this paper is twofold. First, it documents the changing global landscape before and after the crisis, emphasizing the shift towards multipolarity. In particular, it emphasizes the ascent of developing countries in the global economy before, during, and after the crisis.\n\nSecond, it explores what these global economic changes and the recent crisis imply for shifts in the direction of research in development economics. The paper places a particular emphasis on the lessons that developed countries can learn from the developing world.\n\nThis paper is a product of the Development Economics Vice Presidency. It is part of a larger effort by the World Bank to provide open access to its research and make a contribution to development policy discussions around the world. Policy Research Working Papers are also posted on the Web at http://econ.worldbank.org. The author may be contacted may be contacted at ann.harrison@berkeley.edu and Csepulveda@worldbank.org.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    The Policy Research Working Paper Series disseminates the findings of work in progress to encourage the exchange of ideas about development issues.

      "3": "# Introduction \n\nThe 2008-9 financial and economic crisis has shown that the world economy and its recovery are much more fragile and interdependent than previously thought. The crisis has also revealed that we are in a new world, with multiple sources of growth and new powerful links between developing and developed countries and among developing countries. The crisis accelerated the change in the global economic landscape, one in which developing countries have acquired increasing importance in global economic growth and share of global GDP. Nearly half of global growth today comes from developing countries.\n\nThe crisis and the new global economic landscape that has emerged with developing countries taking center stage has not only given rise to the Group of 20 (G-20) as the relevant forum for global economic cooperation, but it has also compelled policymakers and researchers to question whether development economics in its present form is well positioned to tackle the most urgent issues of the day. What can developed countries learn from the rise of the emerging economies? These two landmark developments, the severe 2008-2009 crisis and the changing global landscape, have led to a serious questioning of the old orthodoxy.\n\nThe aim of this paper is twofold. First, we document the changing global landscape before and after the crisis, emphasizing this shift towards multipolarity. In particular, we emphasize the ascent of developing countries in the global economy before, during, and after the crisis. Second, we explore what these global economic changes and the recent crisis imply for shifts in the direction of research in development economics. We place a particular emphasis on the lessons that developed countries can learn from the developing world.\n\nWe emphasize four sets of issues that deserve attention moving forward. First, we emphasize the importance of structural transformation in the process of economic development, and the role that the government can play in accelerating or retarding that process. Second, we discuss the importance of promoting inclusive growth, which we refer to as broadening opportunities. Third, we highlight the increasingly risky global environment, with fluctuations in weather, capital flows, and trade highlighted in particular. Finally, we underline the importance of aid effectiveness, and seek to understand how we can better learn from results. These four areas we",
      "4": "refer to as the \"TORR\" framework, which is shorthand for a focus on transformation, opportunities, risks and results.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section 1 presents stylized facts of the global economic landscape since the early 1980s and projections into 2030. Section 2 discusses the researchable questions and lessons that have emerged post-crisis, grouped into four set of issues: Transformation, Opportunities, Risk, and Results (TORR). The last section concludes.\n\n# 1. A New Global Economic Landscape \n\nThe increasing importance of developing countries in the new global economy and in the global political arena was evident long before the 2008-09 crisis. The crisis-which originated in the developed countries and affected them more severely--only served to reinforce the recognition of decade-long shifts in the global economy. This new global economic landscapein which developing countries are playing a central, if not lead, role-was acknowledged in November 2008 when for the first time the Group of 20 (G-20) leaders convened in Washington, D.C., to consider cooperative efforts to cope with the financial crisis and to lay the foundations for restoring sustainable and balanced growth. ${ }^{2}$\n\n## Before the Crisis: Stylized Facts\n\nThe increasing globalization that the world has experienced in recent decades-supported by multilateral trade policy reforms, broad liberalization in domestic trade and investment environments, and technological advances-has facilitated the acceleration of growth in developing countries and, by extension, the importance of these countries in the global economy. These changes in the global economic landscape are not the outcome of the crisis, but rather the result of decade-long shifts, as discussed below.\n\nIf we use a conventional measure of trade volumes, such as export shares in GDP, developing countries are now more integrated into the world economy than developed countries. Figure 1 shows that developing country exports surpassed developed country exports as a share of GDP in the early 1990s. By the mid-2000s, developing country shares of exports in GDP exceeded developed countries by at least 5 percentage points of GDP. Figure 1 also documents\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ See Fardoust, Kim, and Sepulveda (2011).",

China overtook the developed country average in the mid-1990s, and surpassed the developing country average around the same time that it entered the WTO, at the end of 2001.\n\nFigure 1 Export Shares in Developing and High-Income Countries\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n\nSource: World Development Indicators\n\nIt is likely that this increasing globalization is one factor that can be used to explain the high growth rates that developing countries exhibited over the last decade. During the 2000s, developing countries grew on average at 5.6 percent and in 2010, developing countries are estimated to grow at 7.0 percent (World Bank (2011)). In comparison, developed countries grew at only 1.3 percent in the previous decade and in 2010 are estimated to grow at 2.8 percent (see Figure 2a). However, these high growth rates in developing countries mask the vastly different growth patterns of individual economies over the last several decades.",

The figure shows that the regions of East Asia and South Asia grew at higher",
      "7": "rates, on average, than high income countries for decades prior to the crisis. The gap in growth rates between East Asia and the Pacific, where GDP per capita grew at least 6 percent per year since the mid-1980s, and the rest of the world is remarkable. Yet, by the end of the 2000s, all regions including Sub-Saharan Africa were growing at a faster pace than high income countries in per capita terms.\n\n# The Crisis and its Aftermath \n\nThe 2008-09 global economic crisis is possibly the deepest and most complex crisis since the Great Depression. Three primary factors made this crisis unusual in comparison to previous crises. First, the crisis originated in a developed country. Second, many developing countries were able to cushion the effects of the crisis for the most vulnerable groups by increasing or maintaining social spending and safety nets due to strong economic fundamentals prior to the onset of the crisis. Third, and unlike previous crises, developing countries generally fared better and recovered faster than developed countries.\n\nThe crisis originated in the collapse of the U.S. subprime housing market after the burst of a major housing boom in 2007 and subsequent fall in the value of mortgaged backed securities (Bordo (2008) and Gorton (2008)). This led to a crisis in the U.S. shadow banking system that quickly spread to European countries through the drying up of interbank liquidity. Although the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and the Bank of England all provided liquidity in the fall of 2007, the collapse of Lehman Brothers worsened the crisis and the credit crunch led to a recession in the U.S. and Europe. In the early stages of the crisis, most experts believed that its negative impact would be confined to developed countries. As the crisis progressed, however, developing countries felt the effects through various transmission mechanisms, such as trade, commodity prices, capital flows, and remittances leading to a global downturn (Mishkin (2010)).\n\nHowever, unlike other crises, developing countries were able to cushion the negative impact of the crisis on output and human development indicators by implementing countercyclical fiscal policies that allowed them to maintain social spending and increase safety nets. The effects of crises on fiscal and household spending depend on the severity of the downturn, government policy, and fiscal flexibility in continuing spending. Empirical evidence on the cyclical response of government spending to the economic cycle shows a different pattern for developing and high income countries. Developing countries tend to have a procyclical fiscal",
      "8": "policy, reducing spending in a downturn, while high-income countries pursue countercyclical fiscal policy, raising expenditures in a downturn. The latter reflect automatic stabilizers in place as well as discretionary spending to stimulate the economic recovery (Aghion and Marinescu (2007), Talvi and Végh (2000), Perotti (1999), Darby and Melitz (2008), Kaminsky, Reinhart and Végh (2004)).\n\nWhat it is interesting about this crisis is that developing countries have become more sophisticated at fiscal management, and implemented countercyclical spending by temporarily expanding safety nets, protecting social sector spending, and redirecting fiscal resources to retain social services. This is in sharp contrast to the reaction of developing countries to past crises, in which many countries pursued across the board cuts in government expenditures with little concern for the incidence of fiscal allocation. Therefore, although poverty has increased as a consequence of the crisis, it has increased less than would have been the case otherwise. (World Bank (2010a) and Lewis and Verhoeven (2010)).\n\nMoreover, in contrast to previous crises, the 2008-09 crisis found many developing countries with the required credibility and fiscal breathing space to conduct countercyclical fiscal policy. Among the factors that helped developing countries achieve resiliency to the ongoing economic and financial crisis and be much better prepared to respond to this crisis than more developed countries were higher fiscal surpluses, a better build-up of reserves, lower inflation, and avoidance of currency mismatches which could have led to exchange rate speculation and insolvency (Didier, Hevia and Schmukler (2010a, b) and Frankel and Saravelos (2010)).\n\nFinally, unlike previous crises, developing countries generally fared much better and are recovering more quickly than developed countries. This can be seen in Figures 2a, Figure 3, and Figure 4. Figure 2a shows that developing country growth rates fell less and recovered more quickly than developed countries. The projected growth rates, prepared by the World Bank Prospect Group within Research, also show systematically higher growth rates for 2011 and 2012 in developing countries. Figure 3 documents the evolution of trade before and after the crisis. Figure 3 shows that developing countries are leading the recovery in trade, with their import demand rising at twice the rate of that in high-income countries in volumes and values.",
      "9": "Figure 3 Developing Countries are Leading Recovery in Trade\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nSource: Fardoust, Kim, and Sepulveda (2011)\nIt is also possible to compare the performance of developing vis-a-vis developed countries in the 2008-2009 crisis relative to previous crises. Figure 4 shows the growth rates for low income countries five years before and five years after the crises in 1975, 1982, 1991, and the current crisis. The low income countries, compared to the rest of the world, were much less affected and are expected to recover much more quickly. This stands in contrast to previous crises, as captured by the solid yellow and black lines, when the low income countries experienced lower growth and recovered less quickly. In this crisis low-income countries are projected to recover more rapidly than in previous crises, with a V-shape recovery path out of the recession (World Bank (2010a)).",

Also shown in dashed lines are WEO projections until 2013.\n\n# The Changing Global Landscape \n\nThe long term shifts in the global economic landscape, as well as the performance of developing countries in the aftermath of the crisis, have cemented the emergence of a multi-polar growth world. Developing countries contributed around 40 percent of global growth in the past decades, and in 2010 their projected contribution will approach 50 percent (see Figure 5). Because developing countries are growing faster, they are also increasing their share in global GDP. Whereas developing country GDP represented approximately 17 percent of global GDP in 1980, as of 2008 that share had increased to 29 percent, when measured at market exchange rates and close to 45 percent if purchasing power parity (PPP) weights are used. Those that are contributing the most to this new global economic landscape are the developing countries that are also members of the G-20; China, and to a lesser extent India, have been the main drivers of these shifts. In 1980, China accounted for 1 percent of global GDP. As of 2008, China's share had increased to 6 percent of world GDP (11 percent in PPP terms), accounting for a larger share",
      "11": "in the global economy than the economy of Germany or the United Kingdom. India has also emerged as a player, with a 2 percent share in world GDP in 2008, similar to Canada's and Korea's shares. Still other developing countries that represent only a small share of the global economy have experienced a new dynamism and have acted as growth poles in their respective regions. South-South links are also rising rapidly. In 1995 Southern trade was 13 percent of China's total trade; by 2007 it was 28 percent and is projected to reach 50 percent by 2015.\n\nFigure 5 Almost Half of Global Growth Comes from Developing Countries\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nSource: Fardoust, Kim, and Sepulveda (2011)\n\nWhat do these changes mean for the world? The rapid growth of emerging economies has led to a shift in economic power: forecasts based on analysis by the late economist Angus Maddison suggest that the aggregate economic weight of developing and emerging economies is about to surpass that of the countries that currently make up the advanced world. Longer-term forecasts suggest that today's developing and emerging countries are likely to account for nearly",
      "12": "60 percent of world GDP by 2030 (OECD (2010)). But it also suggests a return to a world similar to that of 1820. As Figure 6 shows, China and India will be moving to reclaim their importance in the world economy as it was at the beginning of the 19th century when they accounted for about 50 percent of world GDP (Maddison (2007)).\n\nFigure 6 A Return to Normalcy\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\n# 2. What Can Developed Countries Learn from Developing Countries? \n\nThe development community has engaged in spirited debate over the adequacy of prevailing development frameworks. Some feel that developing countries are recovering rapidly in part because they have followed orthodox policies. Others point to the high economic and social costs of the crisis and the difficulties encountered by countries that have followed such policies but nevertheless cannot succeed in moving into middle or upper income status. Some countries appear to have done well with policies that involve a more active role for the state than envisaged by the Washington Consensus. China's active efforts to solicit and encourage foreign investors through tax holidays are a case in point (Du, Harrison, and Jefferson (2011)). We are also seeing that pro-poor social policies, such as better education and health services for poor people and certain transfer schemes, can help assure more equal access to the opportunities unleashed by market-driven development. However, here too progress has been uneven, with governance problems plaguing efforts to deliver better services to poor people.",
      "13": "Different periods of history have been associated with the rise and fall of different schools of thought in economics. Keynesianism was popular in the 1930s and 1940s, the neoclassical tenets of Milton Friedman and others reached ascendance in the 1980s. In development circles, the Washington Consensus was popular into the 1990s. But now we are asking ourselves how we can go beyond the Washington Consensus. Policymakers and researchers looking at this new global landscape are asking whether development economics in its present form is well positioned to tackle the most urgent issues of the day and whether developed countries can learn from the emerging economies ascent.\n\nThe 2008-09 crisis has made the need to rethink development economics only more compelling and some of the lessons learned are most relevant for developed countries. The World Bank's president summarized the preliminary lessons and key researchable questions going forward in speech he gave at Georgetown University in September 2010. The speech drew on a document prepared by Alan Gelb, Ann Harrison, and Martin Ravallion, \"New Research Directions\"(World Bank (2010b)). The document suggested that new research directions should focus on four broad topics: economic transformation, broadening opportunities, mitigating risk, and focusing on result. We refer to this as the TORR agenda. We need to better understand how economic transformation happens; how to broaden opportunities to ensure that all individuals can participate in the benefits of, and contribute to, such transformation; how to deal with the emerging new global challenges related to risk and vulnerability; and finally, to assess the effectiveness and results of development efforts, including external assistance.\n\n# Securing Transformation \n\nWhy have few countries been able to achieve sustained growth, while others appear to remain trapped in poverty? The Commission on Growth and Development (2008), led by Michael Spence, Roberto Zagha and others, identified 13 countries that were able to maintain high sustained growth over 25 years in the postwar period. ${ }^{3}$ One insight of the Growth Commission report rests in the observation that countries that have made the transition from low income to middle or high income countries have sustained high investment-to-GDP rates (both private and public investment). These differences are shown in Figure 7. By investing resources,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ The Commission on Growth and Development report identified 13 success stories of sustained high growth: Botswana, Brazil, China, Hong-Kong (China), Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Malta, Oman, Singapore, Taiwan (China), and Thailand.",
      "14": "rather than consuming them, economies make a trade-off between present and future standards of living. If the sustained, high-growth cases are any guide, it appears that overall investment rates of 25 percent of GDP or above are needed to achieve growth rates of this magnitude. In addition these 13 countries often invested at least another $7-8$ percent of GDP in education, training, and health.\n\nFigure 7 Investment to GDP Ratios. Selected Countries and Growth 13\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nSource: Commission on Growth and Development (2008)\n\nTo address this fundamental question of why so few countries have sustained high rates of growth requires a deeper understanding of the process of how an economy's structure evolves over time. This is not just about the shift from agriculture to industry and services. This question is about the dynamics within micro-foundations of economic growth. Within agriculture, services or industry how does the process of moving into higher-quality goods and services happen? Within firms, why are some able to move into export markets and start producing new goods, while others languish? How do economies move into information technology and services? What determines a country's economic structure and what contributes to the diversification in an economy? How do firm and industry dynamics-entry, exit and the allocation of resources across firms within sectors and across sectors-contribute to efficiency? Why do certain firms and industries achieve more growth than others, given the same inputs?",
      "15": "Important questions related to this agenda are the respective responsibilities of the market, the state, and the private sector in sustaining the dynamics of structural change. What roles do markets and states play in the transformation? How do political economy and governance factors constrain the scope for effective public action in promoting structural transformation? What should be the role of infrastructure, and who should provide it? The answers may vary, depending on political leadership and the ability of governance structures to withstand capture by powerful elites. However, all successful countries have used market signals and international competition as the fundamental mechanism for resource allocation. For example, in Figure 1 we documented the increasing importance of trade in the integration of developing countries into the world economy.\n\nIn addition to heeding market signals, however, successful countries have also recognized that the state has a role to play in the transformation process. The role of the state in promoting certain patterns of industrial development has been a highly contentious subject in politics and economic research. Most governments attempt to promote industry, yet evaluations of their interventions have been few and rarely rigorous. There is a pressing need for new research efforts to evaluate these policies. It would be misleading to make general policy prescriptions for successful economic transformation based on the success of a few countries with particular policies and against a particular national backdrop. In many of these example cases, the government played a strengthened role in infrastructure provision, skills development, and creating an enabling regulatory framework. For example, instead of using blanket subsidies to promote exports and attract FDI, the government of China has given companies tax incentives and provided infrastructure for special economic zones in key sectors like electronics and telecommunications to attract multinationals.\n\nThe key challenge is how to design policies that are most effective in achieving structural transformation and diversification by successfully promoting winners, not losers. Harrison and Rodriguez-Clare (2009) distinguish between \"soft\" industrial policy, whose goal is to develop a process whereby government, industry, and cluster-level private organizations can collaborate on interventions that can directly increase productivity and \"hard\" industrial policy that can distort prices. Their idea is to shift the policy design to interventions that deal directly with the coordination problems that keep productivity low in certain sectors. Thus, instead of tariffs,",
      "16": "export subsidies, and tax breaks for foreign corporations, they suggest focusing on programs and grants to help particular clusters by increasing the supply of skilled workers, encouraging technology adoption, and improving regulation and infrastructure, for example. While \"hard\" industrial policy is easier to implement than \"soft\" industrial policy measures, tariffs and subsidies more easily become entrenched and are more subject to manipulation by special interest groups.\n\nLin (2010) and Lin and Monga (2010) argue that policies that target activities which are \"comparative advantage facilitating\" (CAF) type are the most successful in contributing to structural transformation. Governments should not target production activities that are not aligned with the country's comparative advantage. Public policies should be of the \"comparative advantage facilitating\" (CAF) type, helping to solve and overcome the problems of coordination and externalities that beset processes of structural transformation and innovation.\n\n# Broadening Opportunities \n\nThere is also a need to better understand how to broaden access to economic opportunities to ensure rapid poverty reduction and promote human development. Inequalities of opportunities lie at the heart of inequitable growth processes. Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez (2011) have documented the evolution of inequality of opportunities by looking at the top income shares over the long run for more than 20 countries using income tax statistics. They found that in the last 30 years top income shares increased substantially in English speaking countries, China, and India (Figures 8a and 8b). They attribute this increase in part to an unprecedented surge in top wage incomes. Broadening opportunities is as relevant for developing countries as it is for highincome countries.",

Lack of access to opportunities, particularly for investing in education, health, and other forms of human capital, hold back growth and makes the growth that does occur less effective in reducing poverty and inequality. Ensuring better services for poor people is one key",
      "18": "element. However, across countries, social outcomes are only weakly related to spending in social sectors and, in many countries, additional spending on social services is subordinated to other priorities. Understanding why similar programs work better in some countries than others and identifying the binding constraints to better service delivery are key questions to improve access to opportunities.\n\nGovernance plays a role in explaining the inadequacy of services to the poor. Past research has documented large-scale job absenteeism and poor on-the-job performance by frontline service providers. Reforms to improve provider incentives frequently face substantial political opposition, because improving the quality of service delivery is not as politically popular as the provision of protected jobs or price subsidies. Too often front-line service providers and political decision makers have weak incentives to improve services. Publically documenting and understanding these deficiencies in service provision are key to achieving better services. One intervention of this nature focused on using information to train and mobilize local community agencies in India with legal powers to improve the village public school. While this did not have any direct impact on the public school system, it did succeed in stimulating large scale private volunteer teaching which improved literacy levels dramatically. Building on these findings, civil society organizations in Africa and India are experimenting with making local information more available to politicians by disseminating public service performance indicators at the level of electoral constituencies.\n\nAnother important area for development economics research is on gender equity, the focus of the World Bank's World Development Report 2012. Gender disparities in rights, access to resources and economic opportunity, and in voice and political participation vary across and within countries, but remain pervasive worldwide. On the one hand, more rapid development can help attenuate gender disparities. In the other direction, reducing gender inequality can help improve development outcomes. There is increasing awareness of the costs that gender disparities impose on individuals and societies, and of the resulting implications of these inequities for development prospects.\n\nHowever, there are still large knowledge gaps in how and why gender equity matters for development and in the understanding of how best to take account of and address gender differences in policy design. As Figure 9 shows, these questions are complex to tackle, even in",
      "19": "developed countries where equality of opportunity in education has improved, but there are still large discrepancies in outcomes. Figure 9 is taken from Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2009), who present evidence on how career dynamics differ by gender for MBAs who graduated between 1990 and 2006 from a top U.S. business school. Although male and female MBAs present early identical (labor) incomes at the outset of their careers, their earnings soon diverge, with the male annual earnings advantage reaching almost 60 log points at ten to 16 years after MBA completion. Three reasons have been identified by the authors for the large and rising gender gap in earnings: differences in training prior to MBA graduation; differences in career interruptions; and differences in weekly hours. Disparities in the productive characteristics of male and female MBAs are small, but the pecuniary penalties from shorter hours and any job discontinuity are enormous for MBAs.\n\nFigure 9 Male and Female Median Annual Salaries by Years since MBA\n![img-10.jpeg](img-10.jpeg)\n\nSource: Bertrand, Goldin, and Katz (2009)\nBroad access to financial services is also crucial for inclusive growth. There is a need to assess and evaluate the channels through which access to finance can contribute to more propoor growth processes, such as promoting entrepreneurship, innovation, and technology adoption. The role of financial literacy and gender differences should also receive greater attention. Ultimately, the aim should be to evaluate the impact of firms' financing constraints and",
      "20": "households' inability to access financial services on economic growth and poverty alleviation, and to better identify different ways to improve access, ranging from microfinance innovations to making improvements in the functioning of mainstream financial institutions and systems. For example, one frequently used policy for improving micro-, small-, and medium-size enterprises' access to bank loans is creating a credit guarantee scheme that insures banks against borrower default. However, there is very little rigorous evidence on the impact of these schemes that can guide policy discussion.\n\n# Managing Risk and Vulnerability \n\nRecent natural disasters (such as earthquakes and tsunamis), health pandemics, wars and civil strife, the oil and food price shocks of 2007-08, and the global economic crisis of 2008-09 have reminded us that the world is a risky, interconnected, and sometimes fragile, place. Moreover, recent history has confirmed that a large fraction of the developing world's population remains particularly vulnerable to these shocks. Developing countries are assessing how the most recent crisis will affect their near-term growth prospects and how they can better protect themselves going forward against current and prospective risks.\n\nIn the area of natural disasters-extreme weather events such as cyclones, floods, and earthquakes- research in Bangladesh has highlighted the success of relatively simple and costeffective protection measures, such as providing emergency shelters large enough to accommodate family members and their livestock, which counteracts households' tendencies to remain in the path of a disaster to protect the bulk of their wealth. Other work on disaster preparedness has emphasized the need for regulatory reform, as well as new regulations to lower hazard exposure. For example, land use regulations to limit settlements in flood-prone areas are often difficult to enforce; reform of commercial building codes and regulations, on the other hand, may help to reduce housing shortages and provide stronger price signals to housing suppliers for improving quality and safety.\n\nAnother important area for research is the establishment of social safety nets at reasonable costs. Safety nets for the poor are sometimes seen as harmful, or at best neutral, to economic growth; however, recent research has suggested that some of these traditional concerns need to be reconsidered. Past work has focused on the problem of avoiding \"leakage\" to the non-",
      "21": "poor and given too little attention to other issues, including assuring better coverage, maintaining incentives for escaping poverty by other means, and devising social protection policies that can act as automatic stabilizers in times of crisis. Such stabilizers do not require long lead times to provide help and do not inhibit access for those in need. Furthermore, the establishment of safety nets does not necessarily mean \"better targeting,\" which can come at (often hidden) costs, including to poor people. The scope for nongovernmental partnerships in social protection has also been under-emphasized in the research community. Developed countries have already learned from safety nets solutions founded in developing countries and transferred to rich ones as is the case of the Mexico's 'Oportunidades' program.\n\nMost countries, including those that have experienced rapid development success underpinned by financial deepening, have suffered from financial crises interrupting the growth process, and sometimes setting back progress for a decade or more. Heightened risks at the level of the individual firm and households have reinforced the role of financial instruments and markets for hedging and managing risk at the micro level. Risk management, including crisis prevention, needs to become a central part of the research agenda on financial development. Building on past work, further effort is needed to investigate the impact of supervision strategies as well as the impact of compliance with Basel Core Principles on bank stability, the interaction of bank insolvency resolution and deposit insurance policies, and the impact of financial globalization on bank efficiency and access to financial services.\n\nAnother important sub-theme concerns how to better utilize and protect various aspects of the global commons in a growing and rapidly urbanizing world. While globalization has been a potent force for development, the recent financial and economic crisis has exposed the fragility of growth to policy failures, the spillover effects of shocks between developed and developing countries, and the global interconnectedness of natural resources. Figure 10 shows that globalization has increased the transmission of global shocks to local economies. While industrial production was not closely linked in Mexico and the United States prior to the formation of NAFTA, after its formation movements in industrial production between the two countries became closely aligned. The increasing interconnectedness of economies through trade and capital linkages must be used to promote shared growth, and means must be found to address the greater risk associated with greater exposure to global shocks.",
      "22": "Figure 10\n\n# Industrial Activity Index in Mexico and USA, 1980-2009 \n\n(Seasonal Adjusted Data, Mexico 1993=100, USA:1994=100)\n![img-11.jpeg](img-11.jpeg)\n\nSource: Esquivel (2011)\nEconomic growth also places increasing pressure on common resources like the environment. Given demographic imbalances between countries, and the threat of larger-scale environmental disruptions in the future, migration also looms as a growing issue. How should global arrangements be reformed to ensure that these challenges are widely seen as important and legitimate, and that international responses provide a robust and supportive framework for sustainable development?\n\nNew challenges can also be expected for food security. Demand for food is expected to grow substantially over the next half-century in response to population growth and rising incomes, especially among the large and populous emerging economies. Agricultural productivity growth is needed, given constraints on the use of additional land or water, but in recent decades productivity growth appears to have slowed, in part because of past cutbacks in support for public agricultural research and development. Further sharp spikes in food prices, as in 2007-08, are expected when adverse shocks coincide with low stock levels. One of the",

How should evaluations be conducted and how can delivery mechanisms be improved to generate better results? What innovative roles can public-private partnerships provide? How can development loans and aid avoid undermining accountability mechanisms in recipient countries, and promote rather than discourage policy reform? Aid and loans, whether stemming from public or private sources, are not the main drivers of development success. The dominant role has to be played by the populations and governments in the countries concerned.

There is still much work to be done in improving these data, such as in reducing comparability problems, understanding data inconsistencies, reducing biases in data collection, and better linking across types of data. At the macro level, research has long had an important role in creating the tools, especially the data, needed for monitoring overall development effectiveness at country and sub-national levels. At the micro level, credible evaluations of development policies and projects (both ex ante and ex post) are accompanied by continuing methodological and data-related challenges. Methods will vary depending on the nature of the interventions that are being studied. There have been important advances in the use of both experimental and non-experimental evaluation methods for assigned programs (meaning that some observational units get the programs and some do not). However, these tools can be misleading for informing development policy (including scaling up) and may not be appropriate",

Conclusions \n\nThis essay presents empirical evidence of the better growth performance of developing countries before and after the 2008-09 economic and financial crisis and how this better performance has led to a changed global economic landscape in which developing countries are taking center stage as multiple growth poles emerge. Nevertheless, against this backdrop it is important to acknowledge that this paper has not addressed issues like global imbalances, decreasing aid budgets, and trade protectionism, among others, that may influence the growth and development of developing countries in the future.\n\nWe also present a new research framework for development economics that highlights key topics to be addressed, and critical researchable questions, which can offer lessons to developed countries. This new framework encompasses four areas we refer to as the \"TORR\" agenda. First, Transformation, that is, what underlies structural changes? Second, Opportunities, how can it be ensured that the benefits of growth are shared by all? Third, how can countries manage the Risks associated with environmental, trade, and financial shocks? Fourth, the profession must orient its policy prescriptions around a new focus on Results and aid effectiveness.",

However, at the APEC meetings in Bogor in November 1994, commitment was made to forming an APEC free trade area (or FTA). The apparent hope is that the resulting beneficial momentum towards increasing trade liberalization and growth will outweigh the potential rise in exclusionary pressures, as members raise trade barriers against non-members, or engage in strategic behavior in order to gain individual advantage at the expense of the broader region. While rarely openly identified, these pressures are evident in East Asia in areas ranging from the debate over the proper role of APEC, negotiations concerning the pre-requisites for and timing of China's admission to the new World Trade Organization, efforts to maintain a separate role for ASEAN, and even suggestions that any Asian free trade arrangement should exclude the United States.\n\nThis paper explores three issues: (1) the impact of an APEC FTA on trade, welfare, and economic structure of the Pacific Rim economies and the European Union (EU); (2) the implications of forming a partial FTA excluding a potential partner such as China, the ASEAN economies, or the US; and (3) the relative benefits of an APEC FTA compared to full trade liberalization, including the EU.\n\nWe analyze these issues using a multi-country, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The model provides a simulation laboratory for doing controlled experiments, changing policy parameters and measuring the impact of the changes on the various economies and on international trade. We use the model to simulate a series of alternative liberalized trade scenarios, starting with a base case in which all tariff and most non-tariff barriers are removed among the APEC countries (US, Japan, Asian NIEs, China, and ASEAN). In order to see if there are potential strategic trade conflicts, we consider scenarios in which one economy is excluded. Finally, we consider a scenario of world trade liberalization, including the EU, to compare the benefits with those arising from regional integration.\n\nAPEC Free Trade Area: In the APEC trade liberalization scenario, we find that all APEC countries gain in GDP, while the excluded EU loses slightly. The gains are larger for the poorer countries, for whom the trade externalities are more significant. Trade expansion is quite large, and although there is some trade diversion away from the EU and the rest of the world, it is swamped by trade creation within the FTA. While the aggregate trade balance for each country is assumed to be determined by macro phenomena and is held fixed in the model, bilateral balances change significantly. However, the US-Japan trade balance improves only slightly (by $\\$ 1.4$ billion), while the US-China balance worsens slightly. Movements in other bilateral balances are much larger, suggesting that the changes in sectoral protection levels involved in forming an FTA make movements in particular bilateral trade balances nearly impossible to predict a priori.\n\nThe Effects of Excluding Countries from the APEC FTA: There are gains from making the FTA as broad as possible: omitting any one region (US, China, or ASEAN4) makes that region significantly worse off, and lowers the gains from the FTA for all other members as well. The Asian NIEs have the most to gain from broad membership. Exclusion of China reduces Asian NIE gains by about half, and exclusion of the US yields even larger declines. Exclusion of the US has the greatest negative impact on all other potential members, larger than the effect of omitting either China or ASEAN4. The EU is largely unaffected by different versions of the APEC FTA.\n\nRegionalism versus Global Liberalization: Finally, broader world trade liberalization, including the EU along with APEC, is the best outcome in terms of world GDP and welfare. Furthermore, all countries individually gain more from global liberalization than they do from joining an APEC FTA alone. While the formation of a regional FTA may well be politically easier than achieving continued global liberalization, there are economic incentives for all parties to expand on the achievements of the completed GATT round.",

      "8": "# 1. Introduction \n\nThe growing interest in and acceleration towards regional integration arrangements represents one of the most significant paradigmatic shifts in the international policy arena over the last several decades. Only a decade ago, the conventional wisdom was that the scope for successful regional free trade initiatives was relatively limited, with the international landscape littered with examples of efforts that had fallen short of their original lofty goals. Preliminary negotiations over the Uruguay Round were just beginning in an environment characterized by suspicion over hidden agendas and North-South confrontation. An outside observer would have found tangible progress only among the industrialized nations of the (then) European Economic Community and North America, and even there the controversy engendered by efforts to define common standards, tax, and tariff regimes might easily have suggested that these initiatives would likely suffer a bureaucratic death. Earlier regional initiatives among the developing countries (such as the Andean Pact) had collapsed, and regional organizations that achieved some success (such as ASEAN) had done so by restricting their scope to cooperation on political and security issues.\n\nThe situation of a decade ago seems like ancient history when viewed from our current vantage point. The signing and implementation of the NAFTA agreement linking the North American economies has erased the notion that free trade agreements between developing and industrial economies were unattainable. After many years of uncertainty, the successful completion of the Uruguay Round Agreement (URA) has imparted substantial forward momentum to multilateral trade liberalization. New or revitalized regional groupings are advancing ambitious agendas of regional cooperation and trade liberalization, ranging from the Mercosur and Andean Pact groups in the Western Hemisphere to ambitious expansion plans for the European Union in coming years.\n\nDespite this progress, substantial tensions remain in several areas. While the URA represents a victory for multilateralism, the possible proliferation of regional agreements has amplified concerns over",
      "9": "the potential costs imposed by separation of the trading system into exclusive blocks. ${ }^{1}$ NAFTA has set off a scramble in the Western Hemisphere among those not yet included, with nations from the Caribbean to Chile struggling with alternatives ranging from NAFTA accession to formation of separate free trade areas. In Asia, fears are expressed regarding the potential trade diversion that might occur as a result of NAFTA implementation, although most empirical estimates suggest that the losses would be small. ${ }^{2}$\n\nWithin East Asia, similar pressures are evident as well. The Pacific Rim members of the newly formed APEC forum have widely divergent views over the desirable role of this group in fostering trade liberalization. Some nations (such as the U.S. and Singapore) advocate free trade among APEC members by the year 2020, while others (led by China and Malaysia) argue for less ambitious objectives. Meanwhile, the evolution of APEC has forced the six ASEAN nations to reconsider the appropriate role for that group. Several years ago this group committed to plans for an ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) that would reduce tariffs on most products to a maximum of 5 percent among the members by 2008: The pressure of events elsewhere recently resulted in an ASEAN decision to broaden the scope and accelerate the timetable so that major reforms would be completed by 2003 instead.\n\nAmong the factors generating pressure on Asian (and other) economies is the increasing globalization and integration of world markets, particularly as more and more regions leave behind their inward-looking policies and look outward for growth and markets. Import substitution policies and investment controls once provided insulation from international economic pressures to countries that adopted them, albeit at enormous cost. In today's climate, with massive (and somewhat fickle) foreign\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ Hughes Hallett and Primo Braga (1994) assess the implications of increased regionalism on progress towards a more liberal trade order, and conclude regional arrangements are unlikely to work as building blocs towards a \"perfect\" GATT. Instead, they argue that the best approach for developing countries threatened by the growing strength of regional arrangements is to encourage and strengthen the multilateral trade system, particularly the emerging WTO.\n    ${ }^{2}$ For example, using partial equilibrium and gravity flow trade models, Primo Braga, Safadi, and Yeats (1994) estimate that total NAFTA-induced trade diversion losses could cost East Asian economies around $\\$ 380-700$ million, concentrated largely in sectors where high U.S. trade barriers exist. But as they point out, these losses are less than 1 percent of the gains that are expected to accrue to this region from successful implementation of the URA.",
      "10": "capital flows, and increasing competitive pressures in export markets, it is not enough for countries to simply make progress towards a more open trade and investment regime; exporting economies must devote equal attention to what their competitors are doing.\n\nThis situation seems particularly prevalent in East Asia. Without question, this region has benefitted enormously from rapid growth in world trade: The World Bank (1994) reports that over the last twenty-five years, the region's exports have grown by a factor of thirty, corresponding to an increase in the share of world exports from 7 to 21 percent. This report goes on to argue forcefully that East Asia should aggressively pursue liberalization at a pace faster than that promised in the URA in order to provide a locomotive to pull the world trading system towards greater openness. But running counter to this sentiment is a less optimistic perception that the ordered historical progression of export-led growth from Japan to the Asian \"tigers\" to the next tier has now been supplanted by a more chaotic scramble for advantage in an increasingly competitive world. The response to trade liberalization for one country in Asia depends not only on its own actions, but also on what other countries do as well. For example, the impact of China's resurgence on the region (as well as the possible costs of any renewed isolation or exclusion from the WTO), the potential competition from Vietnam, and the long-run effect of changes in the distribution or magnitude of foreign investment flows into the region were important factors behind the recent ASEAN decision to accelerate the timetable for its own free trade area.\n\nIt can be argued that concern over the policy environment in a country's economic neighbors may be beneficial, and even create momentum towards a self-fulfilling or virtuous circle of liberalization. But there is also the danger that such concerns can increase exclusionary pressures, or encourage strategic behavior that benefits the individual country but at the expense of the broader region. ${ }^{3}$ While rarely openly identified as such, these pressures are evident in East Asia in areas ranging from the debate over\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ For example, Hinojosa-Ojeda, Lewis, and Robinson (1994) analyze the potential for welfare-reducing \"prisoner's dilemma\" outcomes in an analysis of regional integration options for Central America and the Caribbean after NAFTA.",
      "11": "the proper role of APEC, the ongoing negotiation over the pre-requisites for and timing of China's admission to the WTO, efforts to maintain a separate role for ASEAN, and even suggestions that any Asian free trade arrangement should exclude the United States.\n\nThis paper provides an empirical assessment of two different questions related to regional integration options for the broad Asian region:\n(1) What is the impact of an APEC free trade area on trade, welfare, and economic structure in the Pacific Rim economies?\n(2) What are the implications of pursuing free trade initiatives when one major partner is excluded? In particular, who gains and who loses when either China, the ASEAN economies, or the US is excluded from the FTA.\n(3) How do the various FTA alternatives compare with the more ambitious scenario of full world trade liberalization?\n\nWe approach these questions using a multi-country, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to analyze the impact of trade liberalization on countries, sectors, and factors. Our APEC CGE model consists of six linked country models: US, Japan, EU, Asian NIEs (Korea, Taiwan, Singapore), China (including Hong Kong), and ASEAN4 (Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, and Malaysia). ${ }^{4}$ Each country model has ten sectors and two labor types, and is linked to other countries through explicit modeling of all bilateral trade flows for all traded sectors.\n\nWe use the model to simulate a series of alternative free trade scenarios, starting with a base case in which all tariff and non-tariff barriers are removed among the APEC economies (US, Japan, Asian NIEs, China, and ASEAN). We then contrast these static results with a model scenario that incorporates the notion that increased trade (or \"openness\") creates various externalities that directly increase\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{4}$ Our APEC model does not include all current members of APEC, of which there are now eighteen. Excluded from our model are the industrial economies of Australia, New Zealand, and Canada, the small Pacific economies of Brunei and Papua New Guinea, and Mexico and Chile in Latin America.",
      "12": "productivity. Finally, we consider the implications of a free trade arrangement in which one economy (either China, ASEAN4, or the US) is left out, in order to assess quantitatively whether ASEAN4 or China gain from the exclusion of the other, and whether the Asian region is better off proceeding without the US as a partner.\n\nThe next section provides an overview of the economic structure, trade linkages, and structure of protection among countries in the APEC region, while also introducing the data used in our model. Section three introduces the conceptual tools that are needed to analyze trade liberalization and regional integration, and presents the main features of our APEC CGE model. Section four presents the alternative regional integration scenarios, and section five presents conclusions. An appendix contains a more complete description of the model.\n\n# 2. Economic Structure and Trade Patterns in Major APEC Economies \n\nOur APEC model is constructed around a six-region, ten-sector, four-factor Social Accounting Matrix estimated for the year 1992. ${ }^{5}$ This section outlines the structure of production, demand, income, taxation and trade patterns in the base year for each economic region included in the model, and briefly describes the patterns of protection among the relevant regions. The purpose of this SAM-based data analysis is to provide an overview of the structure and linkages among the regional economies and lay the groundwork for an understanding of the simulation results reported later in this paper. ${ }^{6}$\n\nTable 1 presents data on factor endowments, intensities, and costs for the regions included in the model. It reveals enormous differences in factor endowments and factor cost among these regions.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ The data set is drawn primarily from the GTAP 1992 dataset, version 2, which is described in Hertel (1995). Features of this type of multi-regional SAM and aspects of its construction are described in Wang (1994).\n    ${ }^{6}$ Note that for model regions that are made up of more than one national economy (ASEAN4, Asian NIEs, China, and EU), all figures on exports and imports reported in these tables (and used in the model) refer to trade with economies outside that region, and thus exclude trade that occurs among members of the same region. In constructing the regional data sets, this \"within region\" trade is netted out and treated as another source of domestic demand. Thus care must be taken in comparing trade shares and structure with other published sources on regional trade flows that do not adjust for this intra-regional trade.",

International trade theory generally identifies two different types of international trade. Trade among developed industrial countries with similar endowments and technology has been increasingly characterized as \"intra-industry,\" whereas trade between high and low-income economies that have different factor endowments and technological processes is still on an inter-industry basis. The tremendous range in factor endowments and level of economic development among our model economies suggest that perhaps the traditional Heckscher-Ohlin arguments (based on different factor endowments) may explain trade among them to a large extent.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    \"Intra-industry\" in this context refers to the two-way trade between industries which produce commodities that are similar in input requirements and highly substitutable in use, such as similar televisions manufactured by different producers.",
      "15": "Table 2 presents the share of each region's exports and imports in total world trade from the base data used in the model. Aggregation of individual economies into regions for use in the model involved netting out trade among the combined economies, so that these data will not match data from other statistical sources on world trade volumes. ${ }^{6}$ Overall, trade among the APEC regions in the model accounts for 70 percent of the total trade, with the rest of the world representing the rest.\n\nTable 3 summarizes information on the sectoral structure of each region economy. Data are reported for base-year sectoral shares of output (column 1), value added (2), final demand (3), imports (4) and exports (5). Columns 6-7 show the share of exports in output and the share of imports in demand. Columns 8-11 describe the functional income distribution for each sector.\n\nThese data clearly delineate differences in structure and international comparative advantage among ASEAN4, China, the Asian NIEs, and industrial countries such as Japan, the United States, and the European Union. ASEAN4 and China are more primary-intensive than the industrial countries, and their manufacturing sectors, especially the labor-intensive textile and apparel products, are relatively larger than in the advanced countries because of a smaller service sector. Japan, the European Union, and the United States are dominated by a large service sector with a much smaller labor-intensive manufacturing sector. Again, the Asia NIEs lie between China and ASEAN4 and the industrial countries.\n\nTrade shares are also consistent with intuition about each region's international comparative advantage. For example, a labor-intensive industry, textile and apparel, constitutes 18 percent of ASEAN4 and 42 percent of China's total exports, while machinery and equipment, which is capital and technology-intensive, makes up about 45 and 38 percent of their total imports respectively. The reverse is true for Japan and the United States. The Asia NIEs are in between, with a lower textile export share\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{6}$ For example, the figures for ASEAN4 exclude trade among these four economies; similarly, the rest of world figures include only trade between the rest of world and other regions in our model, not among the many countries lumped together in our rest of world aggregate.",
      "16": "but a much higher machinery export share than China and ASEAN4, but a higher textile export share and a lower machinery and equipment export share than Japan and the United States. ${ }^{9}$\n\nColumns 6 and 7 in Table 3 present sectoral shares of exports in gross output and imports in total demand as measures of trade dependence. Because of their geographical location and the smaller size of individual members, ASEAN4 and Asian NIEs have the highest trade dependence, especially for the capital-intensive machinery and equipment industries. Fifteen years of market-oriented economic reform have also led China to become more strongly linked with the world economy, especially in manufacturing products. In 1992, China exported more one third of its labor-intensive textile and apparel output and imported one third of its machinery and equipment from abroad. The United States and Japan, as the two largest economies in the world, are relatively more self-sufficient. However, Japan's poor natural resource base leads it to rely on other countries for nearly half of its total mineral and energy use, while it exported nearly one-fourth of its total machinery and equipment production to foreign markets. Although the United State has relatively low trade dependency, at the sectoral level it exports significant shares of its textile and capital goods output, and imports large amounts of nondurable manufactured goods (textiles and apparel), machinery and equipment, and energy and mineral products.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ Textiles provides an illustrative example of the point made earlier about the elimination of \"intra-regional\" trade during the combination of countries into our regional aggregates. If Hong Kong were included with the Asian NIEs rather than with China, then the share of textile exports rises in China (now excluding Hong Kong) but remains unchanged in the Asian NIEs (including Hong Kong). This occurs because the separation of China and Hong Kong means that the enormous export of textiles from China to Hong Kong (presumably for subsequent re-export) is counted as a Chinese export, rather than netted out as part of the consolidation of the individual country data sets.",

      "20": "Table 4 presents data on the directions of net trade flows in the base year for the regions in the model. They show that, among the advanced countries, minerals and energy are the major import sector, while capital-intensive manufactures are generally major net export sectors, except for machinery and equipment in the United States, where there is a large deficit with Japan ( $\\$ 58$ billion). The US is a net net exporter of agricultural and food processing products and services, the EU has a surplus in food processing, intermediates, machinery, and services, and Japan has an enormous surplus (over $\\$ 200$ billion) in the machinery and equipment sector, with much smaller positive balances for textiles and intermediates. China and ASEAN4 trade patterns exhibit some similarities: They are both net importers of capital-intensive manufactured products (basic intermediates, machinery and equipment), net exporters in labor-intensive manufactures and other primary products, and largely self-sufficient in food grains. The ASEAN4 trade surplus is diversified across mineral and energy products and other resource-based sector as well as in textiles and apparel. The net trade data for the Asian NIEs reveal that these economies are net exporters both of labor-intensive manufactures (like China and ASEAN4) and technology and capital-intensive machinery and equipment (like the industrial countries), and net importers of intermediates and mineral and energy products. At the aggregate level, the Asian NIEs have a trade surplus with the United States, European Union, and China, but a large trade deficit with Japan.\n\nTables 5 and 6 present data on the market shares of exports and imports, and on the sectoral composition of exports by destination and imports by source. It is apparent that East Asian countries have become important markets for developed countries, especially their manufactured products. The export share of the United States and European Union in the capital-intensive manufactured goods market to the Asian NIEs has exceeded their share to Japan. Asian countries have also become the largest market for manufactured intermediate exports from Japan. The data on the sectoral trade structure further show that most of the trade among the six regions included in the model is concentrated in manufactured goods, notably on labor-intensive consumer goods, basic intermediates, and machinery and equipment.",

      "25": "On the other hand, it is also apparent that China and ASEAN4 rely heavily on industrial countries as final markets for their exports, especially their natural resource-based sectors and labor-intensive nondurable manufactured products. In 1992, Japan represents the largest market for primary resourcebased exports from China and ASEAN4 (forest and fishery, minerals and energy products), while the Asian NIEs and the United States are the largest market for consumer goods exports from these economies. In the meantime, China and ASEAN4 depend on industrial countries, especially Japan and the Asian NIEs as their major supplier of basic manufactured intermediates, and machinery and equipment. The Asian NIEs are also heavily dependent on the industrial countries, especially the United States, as final markets for their manufactured products, but rely more on Japan than the US to supply their intermediate and capital-intensive manufactured goods.\n\nThe United States and Japan are the world's largest importing and exporting economies, but the composition of exports and imports for them is quite different, in both bilateral trade with other Asian regions and trade with the rest of the world. For example, Japan's overall export share of manufactured goods is much higher than its import share, especially in the machinery and transportation equipment sector. The US is more balanced between manufactured imports and exports, but imports a larger of labor-intensive nondurable manufactured goods than it exports. In bilateral trade, manufactured goods account for almost 90 percent of exports from Japan to the United States, with machinery and equipment representing 75 percent alone. Exports from the United States to Japan are considerably more diversified.\n\nFast-growing China and ASEAN4 are emerging as major players in manufactured trade with industrial countries (importing capital and technology-intensive products, while exporting labor-intensive manufactured goods), and have similar comparative advantage in labor-intensive goods, so there inevitably will be competition for markets in the major developed economies. In 1992, ASEAN4 has a larger share in industrial economy markets than China for almost all sectors except nondurable consumer goods, while China's share in the manufactured goods market in Asian NIEs exceeds that of ASEAN4.",
      "26": "These trade pattern similarities suggest that trade liberalization among developing East Asia economies may induce intense competition, especially in export-oriented manufacturing sectors.\n\nThe general impression given by the data on trade and production structure is consistent with intuition about these economies based on conventional international trade theory. At one extreme, China and ASEAN4 are seen as major competitors in labor-intensive nondurable manufactured exports and an important current and future importer of capital/technology-intensive products for their industrialization program. At the other extreme, Japan, the EU and the US are seen as major suppliers of capital/technology-intensive goods and as the final market for labor-intensive consumer products. Asian NIEs are an intermediate case between the two extremes. They are important suppliers of all manufactured goods to China and ASEAN4, and growing demanders and suppliers of technology/capitalintensive products from Japan, EU and the United States, while still remaining important suppliers of labor-intensive goods to industrial countries.\n\nAll this structural information will have important implications for changes in the pattern of trade among regions induced by trade liberalization and economic integration among the economies in East Asia and the Pacific. However, this information cannot be considered in isolation since changes in trade policies and protection levels in any of the regions and sectors will have impacts on other regions and sectors. The strength of a CGE model which includes all participating regions lies in its ability to simulate the shift in trade and production patterns induced by changes in trade policy.\n\nMost general equilibrium analyses of regional economic liberalization focus on the removal of ad valorem equivalent price distortions against imports that arise from existing trade barriers and other sources. This is also the primary focus of the simulations conducted in this paper. It is widely accepted that the pattern and degree of protection are important determinants the impacts of trade liberalization. The larger the initial distortion, the greater the response to a particular policy change. Before reporting on the results of model simulations, it is necessary to provide a description of the sectoral and regional",
      "27": "pattern of trade barriers in the multi-regional SAM. Table 7 presents ad valorem import protection rates for each region by sector and supplier, along with other sectoral taxes on exports and production. Note that these rates include the tariff equivalent of non-tariff barriers for agriculture and textiles, and antidumping duties for the US and EU. ${ }^{10}$\n\nBecause the GTAP data protection rates include non-agricultural NTBs for the US and EU, but only statutory tariff rates for Japan, the resulting protection rates suggest that the US and EU protect themselves much more heavily against Japanese products than Japan does against US and EU products. For example, US protection against Japan ranges from 5-24 percent in the industrial sectors, while the Japanese protection against US products (based only on official tariff schedules) ranges only from 2-7 percent. To compensate for this uneven coverage, we have incorporated additional information on the ad valorem equivalent of Japanese NTBs, drawn from estimates provided in Sazanami, Urata, and Kawai (1995). These estimates, based on unit value index comparisons, suggest sizeable non-tariff protection across a wide range of industrial products. For our purposes, we have chosen to increase reported tariff and NTB rates by one-half of the NTB equivalent calculated by these authors, resulting in the higher bilateral protection rates for Japan reported in Table 7.\n\nThe import protection rates show substantial variations among commodity groups by sector and region. The high protection rates for agriculture and food products in the EU, Japan and Asian NIEs reflect the very high non-tariff barriers maintained in these regions. The average tariff rates in other sectors (except textiles) are generally low among developed countries and Asian NIEs, especially for mineral and energy products. But higher import barriers exist in ASEAN4 for almost all sectors.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ As documented by Chye et al (1995), the protection data in the GTAP database (version 1994) include not only tariffs, but also the tariff equivalent of non-tariff barriers in the case of agriculture and textiles/wearing apparel, and the anti-dumping duties of Canada, European Union and the United States. The tariff data draw on original country submissions to the GATT for the Uruguay Round. The source for agriculture protection data is from OECD and USDA/ERS estimates of Producer and Consumer Subsidy Equivalent (PSEs and CSEs).",

      "29": "Higher rates of protection also apply to individual commodity flows among some regions. For example, the United States and European Union impose higher rates on imports of manufactured intermediates, machinery and equipment from Japan, while Japan imposes higher rates on food imports from most of its trade partners and China imposes higher rate on textile for all its trade partners and on machinery and equipment on ASEAN4. However, these differentiated tariffs by source do not imply that discriminatory tariffs are applied by country. Instead, the differences emerge largely from aggregating the same disaggregated tariff schedule using import weights for each supplier; thus, if one country supplies relatively larger quantities of goods subject to higher tariffs, when this category of goods is combined, the resulting statutory tariff will be higher than for another country supplying low tariff items.\n\nThe domestic tax rates presented in the first column of Table 7 indicate that all regions except China subsidize agriculture. The subsidy in the United States is concentrated on grain production, while in EU and Japan it applies to other agricultural products as well.\n\n# 3. Modeling Regional Economic Integration \n\nIn this paper, APEC-centered regional integration is analyzed through the use of a multi-country computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Such models are designed to quantify many of the economic forces accompanying regional integration that are considered in international trade theory. The APEC CGE model we have developed is in the tradition of recent multi-country CGE models developed to analyze the impact of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations, ${ }^{11}$ the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, ${ }^{12}$ and more recently the implications and options for Central America and the Caribbean of NAFTA implementation [Hinojosa-Ojeda, Lewis, and Robinson (1994)]. In this section,\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ These models, in turn, have built on multi-country models developed to analyze the impact of the Tokyo Round of GATT negotiations - in particular, the multi-country CGE model developed by Whalley (1985). Our model starts from the WALRAS model developed at the OECD to analyze the impact of the current GATT negotiations on the major OECD countries [OECD (1990)] and the RUNS model described in Goldin, Knudsen, and van der Mensbrugghe (1993).\n    ${ }^{12}$ See Hinojosa-Ojeda and Robinson (1992) and Brown (1992) for a review of NAFTA CGE models.",
      "30": "we summarize several important analytic issues associated with analysis of free trade areas and economic integration, provide a brief review of existing empirical analyses of Asian regional integration, and give an overview of the APEC CGE model.\n\n# Assessing the Static Impact of Customs Unions and Free Trade Areas \n\nAnalysis of the consequences of preferential trading arrangements or customs unions on member and non-member countries has long been a major strand of international trade theory. Movements toward European regional integration and the emergence of other regional trading blocs has recently given this work special policy relevance. The theory of customs unions is concerned with the effects of preferential trading arrangements where member countries agree to lower their import tariffs to other members but not to the rest of the world. Free trade areas resemble customs unions, except that participant countries reserve the right to set their own tariffs on imports from the rest of the world, and \"domestic content\" or rules of origin regulations are required to limit the scope of the trading arrangement to goods produced primarily within the countries of the region. ${ }^{13}$\n\nNote that analysis of customs unions or free trade agreements is distinct from the usual theoretical debates over the benefits of pursuing \"free trade\". Since such agreements do not include all countries, only a portion of total world trade is liberalized, and numerous trade and nontrade-related distortions remain after the formation of a customs union or free trade area. As a result, the relevant theory is concerned with the task of comparing different \"second-best\" situations, with the standard outcome that the greater realism permitted by departing from the unrealistic \"first-best\" case comes at the expense of the generality of the conclusions that can be drawn from theory alone. It is thus impossible to specify\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{13}$ Robson (1987) identifies the two basic features that distinguish a free trade area from a customs union are that \"the member countries retain the power to fix their own separate tariff rates on imports from the rest of the world; the area is equipped with rules of origin, designed to confine intra-area free trade to products originating in, or mainly produced in, the area.\" See Hazlewood (1987) and Gunter (1989) for recent surveys of theoretical work in this area.",
      "31": "general conditions under which the formation of a customs union or free trade area always results in an increase (or, indeed, a decrease) in welfare. The outcome is instead dependent on the relative strength of the \"trade creation\" and \"trade diversion\" effects; which effect dominates is an empirical question. In general, a free trade area increases welfare if its trade creation effects are relatively larger than its trade diversion effects; conversely, it lowers welfare if it diverts trade in net terms. ${ }^{14}$\n\nTrade creation consists of the induced shift in demand away from domestically-produced, highercost products toward lower-cost products produced by FTA members. This shift results in production and consumption effects. The production effect is the savings generated by moving resources out of highcost sectors (relative to other member countries). The consumption effect is a gain in consumers' surplus from the substitution of lower-cost foreign goods for higher-cost domestic goods.\n\nTrade diversion consists of an induced shift in trade away from imports from non-FTA countries to potentially higher-cost imports from a FTA member (depending on the structure of protection of FTA members against excluded countries). With similar external tariff structures for FTA members, removing tariffs among members may only divert trade from non-members to members, with no change or even a decrease in welfare. The shift in trade structure has two potential effects. First, the cost of imported goods may increase (or at least not decrease), as they are now imported from a higher-cost FTA member. Second, consumers' surplus may decrease as a result of the substitution of higher-cost FTA-member goods for lower-cost foreign goods.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ Our definitions here follow Robson (1987). We describe the effects with reference to free trade areas, since these are the focus of our analysis in this paper; the case of customs unions is analogous.

      "32": "# Dynamic Effects of Free Trade Areas \n\nBesides the static effects of trade creation and trade diversion, the creation of customs unions or FTAs could give rise to dynamic effects such as economies of scale, external economies, technical change, and increased investment. Dynamic effects include any effect that might increase the growth rate of economies participating in a customs union or FTA. The existing literature identifies numerous dynamic effects which affect different factor inputs, although there is relatively little consensus on the theoretical validity or empirical importance of these different linkages. ${ }^{15}$\n\nCreation of a customs union or FTA leads to a larger internal market, permitting a greater degree of specialization, and leading ultimately to a reduction in costs. This cost reduction can result from fuller utilization of plant capacity, learning by doing, development of a pool of skilled labor and management, and so forth. Other dynamic effects include external economies, technical change, and change in investment. Of these effects, externalities in the form of technology spillovers are particularly important. According to Gunter and Meldrum (1993), technology spillovers take place when advancements in knowledge made by one economic unit are adopted by other economic units. The creation of customs unions increases the prevalence of technology spillover as trade barriers are reduced. Spillovers can also occur as union members adopt uniform standards which bring together experts from member countries. Spillovers could decrease the cost of innovations; increase an industry's competitiveness; and increase both the technology gap and the difference in average costs between members and non-members of the customs unions.\n\nRelated dynamic effects involve the possibility of increased technology transfer to developing countries as an externality associated with export-led growth. For instance, de Melo and Robinson (1992) suggest that these externality effects are an important factor behind the superior performance of countries\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{15}$ Dynamic effects are summarized by Gunter and Meldrum (1993) with information from Baldwin (1989), El-Agraa (1989), and Gunter (1989).",

The earlier models were used to analyze alternative tariff-cutting proposals in multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT (including the recently completed Uruguay Round) and other international trade policy issues such as North-South trade. More recent studies have concentrated on European Community market integration initiatives and the likely effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) on current or future participants. ${ }^{16}$\n\nThe extensive CGE modeling efforts on Europe and North America economic integration reflect the demand for quantitative assessments of regional initiatives from policymakers in those regions, and these models have played an important role in the public debate over these efforts. The growing interest in economic cooperation in the Pacific Rim, along with East Asia's emergence as the principle engine of world economic growth, has led as well to increased demand for research similar to that conducted on Europe and North America. Until recently, however, contemporary analytic efforts on Asia remain rather limited relative to those on Europe or North America.\n\nFor example, Harrison and Kimbell (1986) developed a 12 -region, 20 -sector model to investigate the impact of trade liberalization and economic interdependence among Pacific Rim countries, although they did not explicitly include Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China in their study. Martin, Petri, and Yanagishima (1994) built a 19 -region, 7 -sector model to estimate the impact of concerted trade\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{16}$ Early surveys of such models can be found in Shoven and Whalley (1984) and Fretz, Srinivasan, and Whalley (1986), while a more contemporary survey is available in Brown (1992).",

While that model has broad regional coverage, it does not model the production structure explicitly: There are no primary factors or inter-industry linkages, so that the structural effects of trade policy change are not easily analyzed.

They found that a trade reform package that extends MFN status to the rest of the world, but does not require reciprocity, is not desirable for the APEC member countries, and suggest instead that APEC members would be better off to withhold tariff reduction with the rest of the world until reciprocity can be agreed to. This policy suggestion is somewhat at odds with that of Martin, Petri, and Yanagishima (1994), who argue the case for a MFN-based liberalization in East Asia without requiring reciprocity from non-Asian regions.\n\n# The APEC CGE Model \n\nThe model developed in this paper consists of a multi-regional CGE framework containing a tensector, six-region, general equilibrium model, where the regional CGE models are inter-connected through trade flows. ${ }^{18}$ For the purpose of describing the model, it is useful to distinguish between the individual \"country\" models and the multi-region model system as whole, which determines how the\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{17}$ The primary reference to these efforts is Hertel (1995).

      "35": "individual country models interact. When the model is actually used, the within country and between country relationships are solved for simultaneously.\n\nThe APEC CGE model includes several features that are not ordinarily incorporated into other multi-country CGE trade models. First, when modeling import demands, the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) specification is adopted. This specification allows import expenditure elasticities to be different from one and also allows cross-country substitution elasticities to vary for different pairs of countries. Second, to capture the potential dynamic effects of trade liberalization, the APEC model can include equations for generating positive externalities through both export expansion and the importation of new capital goods. These new features will be described below.\n\nThe model data base consists of social accounting matrices (SAMs) for each country, including data on their trade flows. ${ }^{19}$ The development of a consistent multi-country data base is itself a major task; for our model, we relied primarily on the GTAP database [Hertel (1995)], supplemented by some additional data on factor endowments, particularly labor and non-tariff barriers in Japan. The SAM starts from multisectoral input-output data, which are expanded to provide information on the circular flow of income from producers to factors to \"institutions,\" which include households, enterprises, government, a capital account, and trade accounts for each partner country, and for the rest of the world. These institutions represent the economic actors whose behavior and interactions are described in the CGE models. The parameter estimates for the sectoral production functions, consumer expenditure functions, import aggregation functions, and export transformation functions were drawn from a variety of econometric and informal sources. The various parameters used in the model represent point estimates for the base year (1992) and the model was benchmarked so that its base equilibrium solution exactly replicates the base data.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{19}$ Social Accounting Matrices are described in Pyatt and Round (1985).",
      "36": "Each sub-regional or \"country\" CGE model follows closely what has become a standard theoretical specification for trade-focused CGE models. ${ }^{20}$ In addition to ten sectors for each country model, the model has four factors of production (two labor types, land, and capital). For each sector, the model specifies output-supply and input-demand equations. Output is produced according to a CES production function of the primary factors, with intermediate inputs demanded in fixed proportions. Producers are assumed to maximize profits, implying that each factor is demanded so that marginal product equals marginal cost. However, factors need not receive a uniform wage or \"rental\" (in the case of capital) across sectors; it is possible to impose sectoral \"factor market distortions\" that fix the ratio of the sectoral return to a factor relative to the economywide average return for that factor.\n\nIn common with other CGE models, the model only determines relative prices and the absolute price level must be set exogenously. In our model, the aggregate consumer price index in each subregion is set exogenously, defining the numeraire. The advantage of this choice is that solution wages and incomes are in real terms. The solution exchange rates in the sub-regions are also in real terms, and can be seen as equilibrium price-level-deflated (PLD) exchange rates, using the country consumer price indices as deflators. ${ }^{21}$ World prices are converted into domestic currency using the exchange rate, including any tax or tariff components. Cross-trade price consistency is imposed, so that the world price of country A's exports to country B are the same as the world price of country B's imports from country A. Composite demand is for a CES aggregation of sectoral imports and domestic goods supplied to the domestic market.

      "37": "Each \"country\" model traces the circular flow of income from producers, through factor payments, to households, government, and investors, and finally back to demand for goods in product markets. The country models incorporate tariff and non-tariff revenues, which flow to the government. Each economy is also modelled as having a number of domestic market distortions. There are sectorally differentiated indirect, consumption, and export taxes, as well as household and corporate income taxes. The single aggregate household in each economy has a Cobb-Douglas expenditure function, consistent with optimization of a Cobb-Douglas utility function. Real investment and government consumption are fixed as a share of GDP in the model simulations.\n\nOne implication of including these varied existing distortions, which capture in a stylized way institutional constraints characteristic of the economies, is that policy choices must be made in a secondbest environment. In our simulations involving the establishment of FTAs, we are not considering scenarios which remove all existing distortions. Existing taxes and factor-market distortions are assumed to remain in place, along with existing import barriers against the rest of the world. In this second-best environment, economic theory gives little guidance as to the welfare implications of forming a FTA.\n\nSectoral export-supply and import-demand functions are specified for each country. In common with other CGE models (both single and multi-country), the APEC CGE model specifies that goods produced in different countries are imperfect substitutes. At the sectoral level, in each country, demanders differentiate goods by country of origin and exporters differentiate goods by destination market. Exports are supplied according to a CET function between domestic sales and total exports, and allocation between export and domestic markets occurs in order to maximize revenue from total sales. The rest of the world is modeled as a large supplier of imports to and demander of exports from the six model regions as a group. Each regional economy faces downward-sloping demand curves for sectoral exports. Production activities in the rest of the world are not explicitly modeled; instead, this region is assumed to have flat export-supply curves and downward-sloping aggregate import-demand curves.",
      "38": "We have built the model to allow for the incorporation of three different kinds of tradeproductivity links. The first relates sectoral productivity to sectoral imports of intermediate and capital goods-the extent of productivity increase depends on the share of intermediates in production. Second is an externality associated with sectoral export performance-higher export growth translates into increased domestic productivity. Finally, there is an externality associated with aggregate exports-increased exports make physical capital more productive, an effect which is \"embodied\" in the capital stock input to the production process. ${ }^{22}$\n\nThe externalities associated with imported intermediate input use ( $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) and sectoral export performance ( $\\rho^{\\prime \\prime}$ ) affect productivity by entering into sectoral production functions [equation (1)], while the externality associated with aggregate exports ( $\\rho^{k}$ ) is directly \"embodied\" as an increase in the initial capital stock $\\left(F S_{k, 0}\\right)$ [equation (2)] and therefore enters the production function indirectly as an increase in the capital input. $F_{i, f}$ are the sectoral factor inputs into the production process (including capital); $X_{i}$ is sectoral output, and $F S_{k}$ is the economywide aggregate capital stock (so $F S_{k}=\\Sigma_{i} F_{i, k}$ ).\n(1) Production function:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\boldsymbol{X}_{i}=\\rho_{i}^{m} \\cdot \\rho_{i}^{\\boldsymbol{r}} \\cdot\\left[\\sum_{f} \\alpha^{i, f} F_{i, f}^{-1^{i, f}}\\right]^{\\frac{-1}{1^{i, f}}} \\\\\nF S_{k, t}=F S_{k, 0} \\cdot \\rho^{k}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n(2) Aggregate capital stock:\n\nThe three externality relationships are shown in equations (3)-(5).

In general, the elasticities used for the industrialized regions (US, EU, Japan) are less than half the values used for the developing regions.\n\nWhile there is fairly widespread agreement that these feedbacks exist, there is less consensus on the channels through which they operate, and how large they are. For our purpose, we are more interested in showing how such linkages might affect analysis of the FTA; thus, we have included three different linkages that operate through different channels. With little empirical estimation to draw on, the choice of externality parameters to use in the model is based largely on guesswork. We have chosen fairly modest parameters, to avoid overstating the case; for example, our sectoral export-productivity linkage effects for the developing Asian regions are given an elasticity parameter around one-half that used by de Melo and Robinson (1992) in their analysis of the Korean growth performance.\n\nFor many single-country and multi-country models, a lack of detailed econometric work forced modelers to use simple functional forms, with few parameters, for the import-aggregation and exporttransformation functions.

The specification generates more realistic trade-volume and terms-of-trade effects when analyzing the impact of expanded North American regional trade under an FTA.

It is important to explore other modeling approaches which permit the analysis of market penetration in environments of product differentiation and imperfect competition. ${ }^{25}$\n\nThe APEC CGE model, like other multi-country CGE models, has a medium to long-run focus.

We do not explicitly consider how long it might take the economy to reach the new equilibrium. The model's time horizon has to be viewed as \"long enough\" for full adjustment to occur, given the shock.

We conclude by comparing the gains from the Asian FTA with more comprehensive trade liberalization encompassing areas outside of Asia. We also contrast the static gains from free trade arrangements with the more substantial improvements that might occur as a result of dynamic linkages between trade expansion and productivity. We specifically model three externality channels which have been identified empirically as important in export-led development, including the effects on aggregate and sectoral productivity of increased exports and the productivity-enhancing importation of new technologies via imports of capital and intermediate goods.\n\nFor each alternative scenario, the model generates results concerning the impact on real GDP, output, trade, value added, the real wages paid to each labor category, as well as the rental rate of capital and land. Trade diversion and trade creation impacts are evaluated through data on total, intra-regional, and extra-regional trade. However, our scenarios should be interpreted as controlled experiments rather than as forecasts of performance that might occur with each option. The actual growth pattern will be the result of many more factors than just trade policy, especially macro-economic and incomes policies. Both the comparative static and dynamic-externality experiments are meant to describe the impact of different patterns of trade liberalization in the medium to long run. Use of the term \"dynamics\" here does not imply the actual path of the transition, but rather the net cumulative effect over time of positive productivity externalities that could potentially result from regional integration.",

In Experiment 1A, tariffs are eliminated under the assumption that there are no externalities or dynamic productivity linkages, while in Experiment 1B, the tariff removal is combined with the three different productivity linkages described in the previous section.\n\nExperiment 1A: Static Gains. Table 8 presents the impact on macro and aggregate trade variables for Experiment 1A, in which tariffs among all five APEC economies are removed entirely.

Export/output shares rise by more than a percentage point in ASEAN4 and the Asian NIES. Real GDP growth, which measures the increased domestic production (at base-period prices), ranges from near zero for the US and China, to an increase of 0.6 percent for ASEAN4, 0.9 percent for Japan, and 2.6 percent for the Asian NIEs.

The EU experiences worsening trade balances with all Asian markets, making up the losses through increased exports to the rest of the world. Some regions expand their net trade with the rest of the world (Japan, ASEAN4, and Asian NIEs), while others (US and China) increase net trade within APEC and suffer declining balances with the rest of the world.\n\nTable 10 decomposes the aggregate trade performance by portraying changes in export flows for each region by sector and destination.

Japanese export expansion to the US, on the other hand, is concentrated almost exclusively in the machinery and equipment category ( $\\$ 19$ billion), with an smaller increment of $\\$ 2$ billion in intermediate products. Again, US tariffs against Japanese products in these two sectors are the highest, although at 22-24 percent the distortions are much smaller than those eliminated in Japan. US export expansion to other Asian regions is varied: while substantial export growth to the Asian NIEs occurs in agricultural products, growth to ASEAN4 and China is relatively modest and concentrated in intermediates and capital equipment as well. Japanese exports to other Asian regions are concentrated in the intermediates and capital goods sectors.\n\nFor China and ASEAN4, the results suggest that there are important complementarities in their export opportunities within the context of greater Asian free trade.

      "47": "for most of the export increase for these two regions to the US, growth in exports destined for Japan occurs in the grains and textile sectors for China, and in the other agriculture and basic intermediate sectors for ASEAN4. China exports more grains to the Asian NIEs, while ASEAN4 increases it other agricultural exports to this group.\n\nTable 11 illustrates the extent of structural change occurring in the FTA economies by reporting the percentage changes in output, export, and import quantities, as well as the reallocation of labor and capital as a result of the tariff reductions. ${ }^{27}$ The changes in output as a result of an Asian FTA reveal the extent to which existing patterns of import protection determine economic structure. Output of grains falls by one-fifth in Japan and one-sixth in the Asian NIEs and imports rise sharply as the substantial agricultural protection in these economies is eliminated. The increased US grain exports to these markets occurs not as a result of increased output (which increases by only 1 percent), but rather through diversion of exports from other markets, particularly the rest of the world. In Japan, there is a massive movement of capital out of agriculture sectors, and agricultural labor from the grains sector. ${ }^{28}$ In the developing regions of Asia, ASEAN4 output of machinery and equipment and textiles grows by 12 percent each, while resource-based sectoral outputs generally fall. China experiences much less structural transformation in terms of output structure, with a 4 percent shift into textiles the biggest change.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{27}$ Little structural change occurs in the EU because of its exclusion from the Asian FTA, so results for this region are not reported in the table. Because exports and imports are reported here in real terms, not dollar values, the figures differ from those reported in earlier tables. Aggregate capital and aggregate labor are fixed, so the sum of changes in factor use is zero; also, agricultural labor is employed only in the first three agricultural sectors, while non-agricultural labor works in the remaining sectors.\n    ${ }^{28}$ At present, agricultural and non-agricultural labor are kept separate, which is responsible for some of the large re-allocations of capital and labor in Japan and the Asian NIEs. Alternative simulations not reported here allow rural-urban migration, thereby facilitating adjustment and reducing the extent of capital reallocation, although the pattern of results changes very little.",

The results from Experiment 1A include no linkages or externalities from greater openness and trade expansion. While this clean comparative static experiment does allow calculation of the efficiency and welfare gains from introduction of the FTA, it also misses some possible important effects. In particular, empirical evidence suggests that there are",
      "50": "positive dynamic feedbacks between trade and productivity which, if captured correctly, would tend to increase the benefits accruing to FTA participants and change the pattern of trade and structural change.\n\nTable 12 summarizes the macro and trade implications of an Asian FTA when these three productivity linkages are incorporated. Any ambiguity from the previous experiment over the attractiveness of the FTA to its members is eliminated in this scenario. GDP, absorption, and consumption rise for all participants; aggregate APEC GDP rises by $\\$ 112$ billion, and aggregate absorption rises by $\\$ 103$ billion. The biggest relative gainers are China and ASEAN4, where GDP and absorption growth increase by 2-4 percentage points compared to the previous experiment. Overall trade expansion rises, although the impact again varies by region: ASEAN4 and China benefit the most, with ASEAN4 export growth reaching 11 percent. Aggregate trade creation is more than five times greater than trade diversion. More than half of ASEAN4 export growth occurs through higher exports to EU and the rest of the world, with nearly all export expansion over Experiment 1A occurring to markets outside APEC.\n\nTable 13: Asian Free Trade Area: Change in Bilateral Trade Balances (Exp. 1B) (Change from Base: Billion US\\$)\n\n| Change in trade balance from: | USA | Japan | China | ASEAN4 | Asian NIEs | EU |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| With region: |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| United States | - | $-1.39$ | 0.59 | $-2.15$ | $-6.06$ | $-3.48$ |\n| Japan | 1.39 | - | 2.12 | $-2.71$ | 2.84 | $-2.54$ |\n| China | $-0.59$ | $-2.12$ | - | $-0.59$ | $-1.36$ | $-0.09$ |\n| ASEAN 4 | 2.15 | 2.71 | 0.59 | - | 3.13 | $-0.38$ |\n| Asian NIEs | 6.06 | $-2.84$ | 1.36 | $-3.13$ | - | $-0.67$ |\n| European Union | 3.48 | 2.54 | 0.09 | 0.38 | 0.67 | - |\n| Rest of World | $-12.48$ | 1.09 | $-4.75$ | 8.20 | 0.79 | 7.15 |\n| Sum | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 | 0.0 |\n\nNote: Trade balance defined as exports minus imports.\nTable 13 shows the impact on bilateral trade balances.

      "51": "again suggesting the futility of focusing on bilateral trade balances in a world driven by multilateral trading patterns. The shifting geographical focus of ASEAN4 trade is evident by the deteriorating trade balances with APEC regions, but improvements with EU and the rest of the world -- in some sense, ASEAN4 is filling markets in the rest of the world that have been abandoned by other FTA members.\n\nTable 14 portrays changes in sectoral exports by destination for each economy in the region. $\\$ 2.5$ billion of the total $\\$ 7$ billion increase in ASEAN4 exports over Experiment 1A occurs in the capital goods sector, and $\\$ 4$ billion more in textiles growth. For China, the net export increment of $\\$ 3.5$ billion is concentrated in the textile sector ( $\\$ 2$ billion), with expansion also occurring in intermediates and capital equipment. Relatively little change occurs in the pattern of export growth within APEC: the industrial economies of Japan and the US exhibit some additional penetration of ASEAN4 and China, but most of their export growth occurring to the rest of the world. Only for the Asian NIEs is the pattern different: most of the export growth in these economies occurs from broad-based export growth to ASEAN4 and China, with modest diversion of exports from the rest of the world to ASEAN4 and China.\n\n# The Costs of Exclusion from the Asian FTA \n\nThe scenarios reported in the previous section are based on the assumption that all of the members of APEC are willing and able to participate in a possible Asian FTA. However, despite the apparent agreement at the November 1994 APEC meetings in Bogor on the goal of free trade by 2020, this outcome is not the only one possible. Both international and domestic pressures could still yield outcomes in which one or more APEC member chose not to participate, or was excluded from such an arrangement. Chinese difficulties at entering GATT/WTO, reluctance by some APEC members to include the US, and misgivings by some ASEAN members over the goal of free trade could over time contribute to evolution of an FTA composed of only a subset of current APEC members.",

      "53": "As these pressures will be played out primarily in the political arena, the model is of little use in predicting the outcome. But it is possible to use the model to consider the economic implications of excluding regions from the FTA. In this section, we consider the impact of three different configurations: an Asian FTA (1) without China; (2) without ASEAN4; and (3) without the US, relating the results to our earlier analysis of the full FTA, including trade-productivity linkages (Experiment 1B).\n\nTable 15 indicates the macroeconomic implications of these alternative FTA membership possibilities. The first set of numbers repeat the findings for Experiment 1B, reported on earlier; the next three sets report results for separate simulations in which one region is excluded from the FTA. The results clearly demonstrate that there are gains from making the FTA as broad as possible. Omitting any one region makes that region significantly worse off, and lowers the gains from the FTA for all other members as well. As expected from the export results reported earlier, the Asian NIEs have the most to gain from broad membership in the FTA: exclusion of China reduces Asian NIE GDP and absorption gains by half, and exclusion of the US generates even larger declines. Aside from the Asian NIEs, exclusion of the US from the FTA has the greatest impact on Japan, reflecting the importance of its potential trade expansion to US markets: Japanese GDP growth drops from 1.4 to only 0.5 percent, and export growth falls from 7 to 3 percent. As further indication of their complementarity, ASEAN4 and China have relatively little impact on one another: ASEAN4 loses 0.5 percent when China is excluded, while China loses only around 0.2 percent when ASEAN4 is excluded.\n\nTable 16 summarizes the impact of the alternative FTA options on trade performance. The broad results are consistent across experiments: regions excluded from the FTA witness a fall in exports relative to the base, and a loss of markets to the FTA. Excluding China reduces US export expansion by $\\$ 1.5$ billion, although this occurs as trade creation within the smaller FTA rises by $\\$ 2$ billion, which is more than offset by a fall in exports to the rest of the world; excluding ASEAN4 lowers US trade creation opportunities by $\\$ 2$ billion. Excluding either China or ASEAN4 lowers overall Japanese trade expansion",

      "56": "by around 10 percent, with trade creation dropping by $\\$ 3$ billion with China out and $\\$ 5.5$ billion with ASEAN4 out. The biggest shift occurs when the US is excluded: the overall magnitude of trade expansion drops by more than half, and all of Japanese export growth occurs to markets within the FTA.\n\n# Regionalism versus Globalism: The Gains from Full Trade Liberalization \n\nThe experiments summarized thus far have contrasted the gains from a broad-based APEC FTA against those from a more narrow grouping where an APEC member is excluded. The results quite clearly suggest that there is an advantage to forming an APEC FTA that is as broad as possible. But one important question remains: how does the APEC FTA compare with the more liberal scenario in which global trade liberalization occurs, encompassing not only the APEC nations but the EU and economies in the rest of the world as well?\n\nTable 17 summarizes the outcome from a simulation that incorporates such trade liberalization (and continuing to include the trade-productivity linkages). Compared to the Asian FTA, everyone gains: the EU is now able to achieve gains from trade liberalization, with a 0.2 percent GDP increase approximately equal to the U.S. gain. The outward-oriented Asian economies continue to benefit from increased access to deregulated export markets, with ASEAN4 growth rising by 1.1 percentage points and Chinese growth expanding by 0.8 percent. Among the developed economies, Japan gains the most, with a 0.3 percentage point GDP rise relative to the Asian FTA.\n\nIn the aggregate, the world is better off with global liberalization: GDP rises by $\\$ 148$ billion (without including any gain to for the rest of the world), and absorption by $\\$ 140$ billion, as compared to increases of only $\\$ 112$ billion in GDP and $\\$ 103$ billion in absorption in the APEC FTA scenario.",

Conclusions \n\nThe simulations reported in this paper provide an assessment of the implications of an Asian FTA from several different perspectives. First, considering the impact of tariff and NTB elimination in a static, neoclassical experiment with no other changes, we find that the formation of an FTA is generally beneficial for its members, although the benefits range from quite small (for the US and China) to moderate (for the Asian NIEs). Trade creation exceeds trade diversion by a factor of four. While the",
      "58": "overall trade balance for each region is held constant, bilateral trade flows are substantially affected. ASEAN4 and China appear to have important complementarities in their export opportunities in the Asian FTA, with different sectoral and geographic patterns of export expansion.\n\nNext, we consider the possible impact of possible linkages between improved trade performance and productivity. Including three different trade-productivity linkages, with relatively modest parameter choices, we find that the case for an Asian FTA is strengthened even further. All FTA members gain, and while the gains for the US are modest (around 0.2 percent of GDP), the gains for other members are quite substantial, exceeding 3 percent for ASEAN4 and the Asian NIEs..\n\nWe then consider the possibility that potential Asian FTA members might chose not to join, or be prevented from participating, through alternative simulations that exclude either China, ASEAN4, or the US from the FTA. The results are consistent: the excluded region suffers losses in GDP, absorption, consumption, and exports, while the members of the smaller FTA gain less than in the case of a broader FTA. These results suggest that, whatever, the political pressures that might exist, the economic justification for not joining (or excluding) potential FTA members is weak.\n\nFinally, we contrast the Asian FTA outcome with more comprehensive global liberalization, and find that global liberalization continues to dominate regional arrangements: all APEC regions gain from broadening the FTA to include the European Union and rest of the world.",

GAMS embodies two related developments of the last several years. First, the increasing power and availability of personal computers allows every modeler to have desktop access to computational resources that were once available only on mainframe computers. Second, the development of packaged software to solve complex mathematical or statistical problems such as that posed by our CGE model has permitted modelers to return their attention to economics.\n\nSeveral syntax rules and presentation conventions are worth noting before continuing with a description of the model. ${ }^{29}$ The main virtue of GAMS is it allows modelers to specify models in (nearly) standard algebraic notation, while leaving the actual solution to GAMS. For the most part, these rules and conventions correspond to standard algebraic practice, so that the modeler need not learn an entire new software \"language\" to use GAMS. Most of the departures from standard algebra are straightforward as well. \"SUM\" represents the summation operator, $\\Sigma$; SUM(i, ... means sum over the index i, while $\\operatorname{SUM}((\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{j}), \\ldots$ means some over both i and j. \"PROD\" represents the product operator, $\\pi$, and \"LOG\" is the natural logarithm operator. The \"\\$\" introduces a conditional \"if\" statement in an algebraic statement. ${ }^{30}$ Parameters are treated as constants in the model; variables are free to vary endogenously, although some of them may be set exogenously as part of the model closure specification. ${ }^{31}$\n\nTable 18 lists the regional, sectoral, and factor classifications used in the model, as well as identifying the sectoral subsets that are needed in the equations of the model. Table 19 contains the parameter definitions used in the CGE model equations. Table 20 contains the variables that appear in the model.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{29}$ GAMS is designed to make complex mathematical models easier to construct and understand. In our case, we are using it to solve a large, fully-determined, non-linear CGE model (where the number of equations and number of variables are equal), although GAMS is suitable for solving linear, non-linear, or mixed integer programming problems as well. For a thorough introduction to model-building in GAMS, see Brooke, Kendrick, and Meersus (1988).\n    ${ }^{30}$ For example, $\\mathrm{PM}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1) \\$ \\mathrm{imi}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1)=\\mathrm{xxx}$ will carry out the expression shown for all $\\mathrm{PM}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1)$ that belong to the set imi(i,k,cty1); in other words, calculate an import price for all sectors in which there are imports.\n    ${ }^{31}$ For example, the exchange rate (EXR) and net foreign borrowing (FBAL) both are listed as variables; in practice, one will be set exogenously, while the other will be determined by the model.",

      "68": "Table 21: Quantity Equations\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\n# Model Specification \n\nIn addition to ten sectors for each country model, the model has four factors of production (two labor types, land, and capital), as identified in Table 18. The output-supply and input-demand equations are shown in Table 21. Output is produced according to a CES production function of the primary factors (equation 1), with intermediate inputs demanded in fixed proportions (equation 3). Producers are assumed to maximize profits, implying that each factor is demanded so that marginal product equals marginal cost (equation 2). In each economy, factors are not assumed to receive a uniform wage or \"rental\" (in the case of capital) across sectors; \"factor market distortion\" parameters (the WFDIST that appears in equation 2) are imposed that fix the ratio of the sectoral return to a factor relative to the economywide average return for that factor.\n\nTable 22: Price Equations\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nThe price equations are shown in Table 22. In equations 4 and 5, world prices are converted into domestic currency, including any tax or tariff components. Equation 13 guarantees cross-trade price consistency, so that the world price of country A's exports to country B are the same as the world price of country B's imports from country A. Equation 6 defines the aggregate export price as the weighted sum of the export price to each destination. Equation 7 calculates the domestic price, net of indirect tax. Equations 8 and 9 describe the prices for the composite commodities Q and X . Q represents the aggregation of sectoral imports (M) and domestic goods supplied to the domestic market (D). X is total sectoral output, which is a CET aggregation of total supply to export markets (E) and goods sold on the domestic market (D). Equation 10 defines the consumption price of composite goods from the composite good price (PQ) and consumption taxes (tc). Equation 12 defines the sectoral price of value added, or",
      "69": "\"net\" price (PVA), as the output price minus the unit cost of intermediate inputs (from the input-output coefficients), plus production incentives from exogenous agricultural producer subsidy schemes (PIE).\n\nIn the APEC CGE model, the aggregate consumer price index in each region is set exogenously (PINDCON in equation 11), defining the numeraire. The advantage of this choice is that solution wages and incomes are in real terms; moreover, since our Cobb-Douglas price index is consistent with the underlying Cobb-Douglas utility function, the changes in consumption levels generated by the model are exactly equal to the equivalent variation. The solution exchange rates in the sub-regions are also in real terms, and can be seen as equilibrium price-level-deflated (PLD) exchange rates, using the country consumer price indices as deflators.\n\nThe circular flow of income from producers, through factor payments, to households, government, and investors, and finally back to demand for goods in product markets is shown in the equations in Table 23. The country models incorporate official tariff revenue (TARIFF in equation 15) which flows to the government, and the tariff equivalent of non-tariff barriers (PREM in equation 16) which accrues as rents to the private sector. ${ }^{32}$ Each economy is modelled as having a number of domestic market distortions, including sectorally differentiated indirect, consumption, and value-added taxes as well as factor, household, and corporate income taxes (equations 17-18 and 23-27). The single household category in each economy has a Cobb-Douglas expenditure functions (equation 35). Real investment and government consumption are set in equations 36 and 37 , while aggregate government consumption and investment are set to fixed shares of GDP in equations 39 and 40.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{32}$ Because the GTAP data source used combines tariffs and NTBs together, in the APEC model data both tariffs and NTBs are treated as tariffs (TM) only, except for the additional NTBs on industrial goods for Japan, which are kept as separate NTBs (TM2).",

Rest of world demand for regional exports can either be modelled as occurring at fixed world prices, or with two alternative mechanisms to capture possible terms of trade effects. First, each region can be characterized as facing its own downward-sloping demand curve based on its total exports (equation 47), where the price it faces is a function of the amount it exports relative to the base. Second, one can characterize the export price for each region as determined by aggregated changes in the export market, so that the average world price is set in equation 48, and each region's export price linked to that in equation 49 by",

The final equations in Table 24 specify how trade-related externalities are incorporated into the model. There are three different kinds of trade-productivity links. Equation 51 relates productivity in production to imports of intermediate and capital goods. The extent of productivity increase depends on the share of intermediates in production. The productivity parameter, SAD2, appears in the production function and profit maximization equations (1 and 2). Equation 52 quantifies the externality associated with export performance - higher export growth relative to the base value at the sectoral level ( $\\mathrm{EK} / \\mathrm{EK} 0$ ) translates into a larger value of the productivity parameter SAD, which also directly affects domestic productivity (equations 1 and 2). Equation 53 represents the externality associated with aggregate exports. Increased aggregate exports yields a higher value of SAC, which is \"embodied\" in the capital stock input into the production process.\n\nTable 25: AIDS Import Demand Equations\n\n| (56) | $\\mathrm{PM}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{k})$ | $=$ | $\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k})$; |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| (57) | LOG(PQ(i.k)) | $=$ | $\\mathrm{AQ}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k})+\\mathrm{SUM}(\\mathrm{cty} 2, \\mathrm{AMQ}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 2)^{*} \\mathrm{LOG}(\\mathrm{PM}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 2)))+(1 / 2)^{*} \\mathrm{SUM}((\\mathrm{cty} 1, \\mathrm{cty} 2)$, <br> $\\mathrm{GAMMAQ}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1, \\mathrm{cty} 2)^{*} \\mathrm{LOG}(\\mathrm{PM}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1)) * \\mathrm{LOG}(\\mathrm{PM}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 2))$ ) ; |\n| (58) | SMQ(imi,k,cty1) | $=$ | $\\mathrm{AMQ}(\\mathrm{imi}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1)+\\mathrm{BETAQ}(\\mathrm{imi}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1)^{*} \\mathrm{LOG}(\\mathrm{Q}(\\mathrm{imi}, \\mathrm{k}))+$ <br> $\\operatorname{SUM}(\\mathrm{cty} 2, \\mathrm{GAMMAQ}(\\mathrm{imi}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1, \\mathrm{cty} 2)^{*} \\mathrm{LOG}(\\mathrm{PM}(\\mathrm{imi}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 2))$ ); |\n| (59) | SMQ(i,k,k) | $=$ | $1-\\operatorname{SUM}(\\mathrm{cty} 1, \\mathrm{SMQ}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1)) ;$ |\n| (60) | $\\mathrm{M}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1)$ | $=$ | $\\operatorname{smq}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1)^{*} \\mathrm{PQ}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k})^{*} \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}) / \\mathrm{PM}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{cty} 1)$; |\n| (61) | $\\mathrm{PD}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}) * \\mathrm{D}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k})$ | $=$ | $\\mathrm{SMQ}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}, \\mathrm{k}) * \\mathrm{Q}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k}) * \\mathrm{PQ}(\\mathrm{i}, \\mathrm{k})$; |\n\nThe specification of the almost ideal demand system (or AIDS) for imports is shown in Table 25.

Similarly, internal migration in each country maintains a specified ratio of average real wages between the rural and unskilled urban markets (the EXR terms become irrelevant).

      "1": "# Abstract \n\nThis study reviews regulatory instruments designed to reduce environmental externalities from the transport sector. The study finds that the main regulatory instruments used in practice are fuel economy standards, vehicle emission standards, and fuel quality standards. Although industrialized countries have introduced all three standards with strong enforcement mechanisms, most developing countries have yet to introduce fuel economy standards. The emission standards introduced by many developing countries to control local air pollutants follow either the European Union or United States standards. Fuel quality standards, particularly\nfor gasoline and diesel, have been introduced in many countries mandating 2 to 10 percent blending of biofuels, 10 to 50 times reduction of sulfur from 1996 levels, and banning lead contents. Although inspection and maintenance programs are in place in both industrialized and developing countries to enforce regulatory standards, these programs have faced several challenges in developing countries due to a lack of resources. The study also highlights several factors affecting the selection of regulatory instruments, such as countries' environmental priorities and institutional capacities.\n\nThis paper-a product of the Environment and Energy Team, Development Research Group-is part of a larger effort in the department to study climate change and clean energy issues.

      "3": "# 1. Introduction \n\nRegulatory instruments are legal, enforceable, \"command and control\" type instruments aimed at reaching the desired, prescribed environmental quality targets or performance standards by regulating behavior of individuals and/or firms (Seik, 1996). In the transport sector, regulatory instruments induce adjustment of market participants' behavior (e.g., purchasing more fuel efficient vehicles, lowering operator speeds, optimizing logistics in freight transport, changing the modal split) by establishing suitable incentives (Ahrens, 2008). Examples of these instruments include the following: Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards established in the United States in line with the 1975 Energy Policy Conservation Act; On-Road Vehicle and Engine Emission Regulations established under the 1999 Canadian Environmental Protection Act; and European Union Emission Standards for Light Commercial Vehicles (i.e., Euro 2, Euro 3, and Euro 4 standards). Depending upon the primary objective, existing regulatory instruments target any of the following: (i) direct control of vehicular emissions or exhaust (e.g., emission standards in European Union, the United States, and many developing countries), (ii) reduction of fuel consumption (e.g., CAFE standards in the United States), (iii) cutting vehicle mileage (e.g., authorized mileage rates in the United Kingdom), (iv) lowering traffic congestion (e.g., the odd-and-even license plate rule in Mexico city). Some of these instruments can spur technological innovations. For example, higher CAFE standards can force vehicle manufacturers to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles; emission or exhaust standards mandate vehicles to be fitted with less polluting engines and emission control systems.\n\nThe key advantages of regulatory instruments are the directness and relative certainty of outcomes due to compliance measures. They boost economic competitiveness and environmental sustainability (Seik, 1996; Hricko 2004; Bartle and Vass, 2007). Strong regulatory programs and other regulatory efforts have had a significant effect on the control of air pollution in many countries (Ringquist, 1993). Regulatory measures alone, however, might not be sufficient to reduce vehicular emissions to the desired level. Therefore, effective pricing or fiscal policies, sound land use planning and the provision",
      "4": "of environmentally sound public transportation systems can reinforce such regulatory measures (Faiz et. al, 1995).\n\nDespite well-established theoretical foundations and wide implementation in the industrialized nations, regulatory policy instruments still present several issues that require further investigation before their widespread introduction in the developing world. The most important issues confronting policy makers in the developing world include, but are not limited to, the following: Which regulatory policy instrument would be the most effective in their context? How to design the implementation mechanisms? Keeping this broad objective in the background, this study presents an in-depth review of various types of regulatory policy instruments, such as fuel economy standards; emissions and exhaust standards; fuel specification standards and inspection and maintenance programs.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly introduces various types of regulatory instruments followed by a detailed discussion of fuel economy standards in Section 3. In Section 4, we review vehicle emission standards. Section 5 and Section 6 present, respectively, fuel quality standards and inspection and maintenance programs. Section 7 discusses other laws and regulatory measures to control transport sector emissions. This is followed by discussions on key factors influencing the selection of regulatory instruments in Section 8. Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 9.\n\n# 2. Types of Regulatory Instruments \n\nRegulatory instruments to control environmental externalities from the transport sector can be classified into different categories using different criteria. For example, Carbajo and Faiz (1994) classified the instruments into three categories based on targets of the instruments. These instruments are those targeting: (i) vehicle engines (e.g., fuel economy standards, emission standards and inspection and maintenance programs); (ii) fuel quality, such as contents of lead and sulfur and mandatory blending of biofuels; and (iii) transport demand (e.g., traffic management through vehicle bans and designating",
      "5": "lanes for high occupancy vehicles). In this paper we classify the instruments based on purpose of the instruments. Our classification is as follows: (i) fuel economy standards, which aim reducing fuel consumption and associated emissions, particularly, $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$; (ii) emission standards which are directly aimed to the reduction of specific emissions released after fuel consumption; (iii) fuel quality standards to reduce or eliminate emission causing elements before the combustion of fuel and (iv) other regulatory measures either discouraging vehicle utilization (e.g., full or partial bans) or encouraging high occupancy of the vehicles (e.g., HOV lanes).\n\nFuel economy standards refer to standards on vehicle mileage per unit of fuel consumption (i.e., km per liter or miles per gallon). These are common ways to control emissions from the transport sector (Faiz et al., 1995). The CAFE standards introduced in the United States are good examples of fuel economy standards. Fuel economy standards help increase energy efficiency of vehicles, thereby cutting fuel demand and associated emissions. While these standards could be effective in reducing fuel demand and emissions, they do not help in reducing congestion. Fuel economy standards also reduce emissions indirectly by cutting fuel consumption in the supply chain, such as crude oil drilling and production, pipeline and oil refinery. For example, Potter (2003) showed that, in the United Kingdom, out of total emissions from an average car, 76 percent were from fuel usage, 9 percent from manufacturing of the vehicle, and the remaining 15 percent was from losses in the fuel supply system.\n\nEmission standards are aimed at directly reducing emissions, the exhaust coming out of the tail pipes of vehicles. These standards are different from fuel economy standards because they directly control emissions from vehicles, whereas the latter reduce emissions by reducing fuel demand. Fuel economy standards are aimed mainly at reducing fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; however, emission standards control local air pollutants, such as suspended particulate matters (SPM), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or non-metallic organic compounds (NMOC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), etc. While fuel economy standards reduce local air pollution, emission standards do not necessarily reduce fuel consumption",
      "6": "as emissions of local air pollutants can be reduced without curtailing fuel consumption by fitting emission controlling devices in vehicles.\n\nFuel quality standards refer to the limit on the content of substances that cause environmental pollution, such as sulfur and lead, in fuel. In order to control emissions of lead and sulfur from vehicular sources, the best approach is to remove these elements from fuels before burning. Regardless of the age or state of repair, lead emissions from all gasoline-fueled vehicles can be eliminated by discontinuing the addition of lead to gasoline. Likewise, emissions of oxides of sulfur $\\left(\\mathrm{SO}_{\\mathrm{xj}}\\right)$ can be abated by reducing the sulfur contents of fuels.\n\n# 3. Fuel Economy Standards ${ }^{1}$ \n\nThe primary purpose of fuel economy standards is to reduce transport sector fuel demand through vehicle fuel efficiency improvements. A number of countries have introduced fuel economy standards, which help to reduce some types of emissions, such as $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, that are directly linked to fuel consumption. An and Sauer (2004) compared fuel economy standards, either already introduced or proposed, in nine countries or regions. The comparison showed that the European Union (EU) and Japan had the most stringent fuel economy standards in the world while the United States and Canada had the lowest standards. China has more stringent standards than those of Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ For some countries/regions (e.g., EU) fuel economy standards are defined in terms of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \\mathrm{GHG}$ emissions per kilometer/miles traveled. Although these standards can be classified as emission standards; we have included them in fuel standards because these standards are implemented through equivalent fuel economy standards.",

Similarly, California specifies the standards in terms of GHG release per mile. An and Sauer (2004) convert those standards to equivalent fuel economy standards for the purpose of comparison.\nSource: An and Sauer (2004)\n\n# 3.1 Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards in the United States \n\nThe CAFE standards require automobile manufacturers to meet stipulated standards for the sales-weighted fuel economy of light duty passenger vehicles sold and to maintain a distinct standard for passenger cars and light trucks (An and Sauer, 2004). Although CAFE is lauded as the main policy instrument to reduce transport sector emissions in the United States, it was, in fact, introduced from an energy security perspective in the mid1970s. The impetus for CAFE was the oil crisis of 1973 (Proost and Van Dender, 2001). Title V of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), passed by the U.S. Congress in 1975, set automobile fuel efficiency standards for the first time in the United States. CAFE was one of the outcomes of this Act (Faiz et al., 1996; Kirby, 1995).\n\nCAFE standards were initially set for cars and light trucks (light vehicles) (DeCicco, 1995). Currently, vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of 1,000 or less",
      "8": "are legally obliged to comply with CAFE standards (Komiyama, 2008). Consumers have responded to CAFE standard by switching from large cars to light trucks, a lessregulated class of vehicles (Godek, 1997).\n\nMinimum acceptable standards introduced by the EPCA began in 1978 at 18 mpg for passenger cars. By 1985, the fuel economy standard had increased to 27.5 mpg . Under intense pressure from lobbyists representing auto manufacturers, it was rolled back to 26.5 mpg in 1986. Fuel efficiency standard returned to its previous level of 27.5 mpg in 1989, where it has remained ever since (Kirby, 1995). The United States Congress, in 2007, passed a comprehensive energy bill, The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which includes a provision to achieve fuel economy of 35 miles per gallon (MPG) for new automobiles by 2020 (Komiyama, 2008).\n\nThe evolution of U.S. CAFE standards presented in Figure 2 illustrates a remarkable improvement in the average on-road fuel economy of new cars and light trucks in the country. Although CAFE regulations do not directly affect vehicles in use, they tend to have a direct impact on the fuel efficiency of each vehicle covered by the standards. Over time, the U.S. CAFE regulations are seen to be successful in increasing average automotive fuel efficiency (Kirby, 1995). It increased from an average 14 mpg in the mid-1970s to 21 mpg in the mid-1990s (Zachariadis, 2006).",
      "9": "Figure 2: Evolution of CAFE standards and sales-weighted average fuel economy of newly registered cars and light trucks in the United States (1975-2004).\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)\n\nSource: Zachariadis (2006)\n\nThe drag that older vehicles impose on fuel efficiency appears to be quite substantial. The increase in the median age of registered automobiles ( 5.9 years in 1970 to 7.5 years in 1990 and 9.0 years in 2001), less stringent regulation of light pickup trucks, vans, and sport/utility vehicles has depressed the growth in fuel efficiency (Crandall, 1992; de Palma and Kilani, 2008). For example, fuel efficiency of all vehicles on the road has increased by only 34 percent even though the fuel efficiency of new cars increased by 76 percent (Crandall, 1992).\n\n# 3.2 Fuel Economy Standards in Other Countries \n\nBesides the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, the European Union, China and South Korea have also specified fuel economy standards for their vehicles.",
      "10": "Australia: The Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries (FCAI) first established voluntary fuel economy standards for new passenger cars sold in Australia in 1978 and lasted until 1987. However, those codes failed to achieve the desired targets (CONCAWE, 2006). In 1996, the Ministers for Transport and Primary Industries and Energy endorsed a second voluntary code of practice, which remained in force until July 2001. FCAI members, under the second voluntary code, agreed to reduce the passenger car National Average Fuel Consumption (NAFC) to $8.2 \\mathrm{~L} / 100-\\mathrm{km}$ (approximately 29 mpg ) by the year 2000. In order to maintain the rate of improvement in NAFC achieved for the period up to the year 2000, a third voluntary fuel consumption agreement was reached between the FCAI and the government in 2003, which calls for reduction in fleet average fuel consumption for passenger cars by 18 percent by 2010.\n\nCanada: The federal government introduced a voluntary Company Average Fuel Consumption (CAFC) standard in 1976 for the new passenger vehicle fleet. In 1982, the fuel economy standards were made mandatory. These regulations are comparable to the U.S. CAFE standards.\n\nJapan: The Japanese government has established a set of fuel economy standards for gasoline and diesel powered light duty passenger and commercial vehicles. The targets to meet the standards are 2005 for diesel and 2010 for gasoline. The standards are based on average vehicle fuel economy by weight class. For gasoline vehicles, it varies from 15 MPG for vehicles weighing more than $2,266 \\mathrm{~kg}$ to 49.6 MPG for vehicles weighing less than 702 kg (An and Sauer, 2004). By 2010, the average fuel economy of gasoline vehicles is expected to increase by 23 percent from the 1995 level. Regulations for both light duty and heavy-duty diesel vehicles are structured differently. An average regulated emission limit value is used for certification and for production control. This limit is complemented by a slightly higher maximum permissible limit value that must be passed for each vehicle unit (Bauner et al., 2008). Assuming no change in the vehicle mix, the targets for diesel vehicles call for a 14 percent fuel economy improvement compared to the 1995 fleet ( $11.6 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{l}$ versus $10 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{l})$.",
      "11": "European Union (EU): After an agreement between the European Commission (EC) and the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) in 1998 and similar agreements with the Japanese and Korean manufacturers (JAMA and KAMA) in 1999, the EU automobile industry committed to a target by 2008/2009. The major provisions of the ACEA Agreement, signed in March 1998, include a $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission target of 140 g $\\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \\mathrm{km}$, representing a 25 percent reduction from the 1995 level of $186 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \\mathrm{km}$, to be reached by 2008 with the possibility of an extension of the agreement to $120 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \\mathrm{km}$ by 2012 (Dieselnet, 2005). The difference between the agreements signed by the European Commission (EC) with the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) in 1998 and with the Japanese and Korean manufacturers in 1999 is that the target of $140 \\mathrm{~g} \\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \\mathrm{km}$ is delayed by one year, to 2009 , for, JAMA and KAMA (Dieselnet, 2005).\n\n# 3.3 Impacts of Fuel Economy Standards on Fuel Consumption and Emissions \n\nThe impacts of fuel economy standards on fuel consumption (Geller et al., 1992; Goldberg, 1998; Greene, 1998) and emission reduction (Decicco, 1995) are helpful in assessing the performance of these standards and their suitability for replication in developing countries. Parry et al. (2004) used the Arizona I/M program data collected in 1995 and 2002 on car and truck emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides $(\\mathrm{NO} x)$, and carbon monoxide (CO) to study the effects of fuel economy standards on emission rates in the United States. They found emission rates were significantly affected by fuel economy standards in 1995 but not so in 2002. This is mainly because the projected CO , hydrocarbon (HC) and NOx emissions per mile for cars and trucks with certified fuel economy of 20 and 30 mpg are virtually indistinguishable over vehicle lifetimes. Based on their findings, they proposed that lifetime emission rates are equivalent for different cars and for different light trucks. Using a vehicle stock turnover model, Decicco (1995) estimated the effect of enhanced fuel economy standards on gasoline consumption, GHG emissions, and hydrocarbon emissions for light duty vehicles in the United States. The author found that an improvement of 6 percent per year in fuel economy would result in savings of 2.9 million barrel of gasoline per day and 147",
      "12": "million metric tons of annual carbon emission avoidance. Likewise, using in-use emission data collected by remote sensing, Harrington (1997) demonstrated a strong association between better fuel economy and lower emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC), which gets even stronger as vehicles age.\n\nDespite the considerable amount of research done on the effects of CAFE on fuel consumption and other related factors, there is no universal consensus on the effects of the CAFE program on the fuel economy of the U.S. vehicle fleet, the overall safety of passenger vehicles, the health of the domestic automobile industry, employment in that industry, and the well-being of consumers (NSC, 2002). Greene (1998) estimated that CAFE standards have led to about a 50 percent increase in on-road fuel economy for light duty vehicles during the period 1975-1995. Improvement in fuel economy forced by the CAFE standards has resulted in an overall decrease in motor fuel expenditure. This means that consumers, in the late 1990 s, spent over $\\$ 50$ billion per year less on fuel than what they actually would have spent at 1975 mpg levels. By contributing to increased fuel economy, the CAFE program has reduced dependence on imported oil, improved the nation's terms of trade, and reduced $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions relative to what otherwise would have been (NSC, 2002).\n\nAlthough the overall goal of CAFE regulation has shifted from reducing fuel consumption in a period of high oil prices to reducing harmful emissions, positive environmental gains resulting from CAFE standard has drawn flak from various quarters (Goldberg, 1998). Dowlatabadi et al. (1996) demonstrated that enhanced CAFE standards might have little or no effect on urban air pollution and a less than proportional reduction in GHG emissions. They argued that CAFE is not the most cost effective way of lowering nitric oxide (NO), volatile organic compounds (VOC) and GHG emissions. Portney et al. (2003) asserted that by reducing gallons/mile, the CAFE standards make driving cheaper, which might lead to an overall increase in pollution.\n\nCrandall (1992) ranked the effectiveness of a carbon tax, a petroleum tax, and CAFE standards in terms of their ability to reduce greenhouse gases. He considered a carbon tax",
      "13": "to be much more efficient than a petroleum tax. CAFE, according to Crandall, would cost the economy at least 8.5 times as much as a carbon tax with equivalent effects on carbon emissions. The inefficiency of the CAFE is mainly because of its failure to equate the marginal costs of reducing fuel consumption across all uses, including usage of older vehicles and non-vehicular consumption. Using an empirically rich simulation model and cost estimates for anticipated fuel economy technologies, Austin and Dinan (2005), compared the cost of the higher CAFE standards against the cost of a gasoline tax that would save the same amount of gasoline. Their findings suggested that a gasoline tax would produce greater immediate savings by encouraging people to drive less and, eventually, to choose more-fuel-efficient vehicles. Fischer (2008) and West and Williams (2005) concurred with Austin and Dinan's assertion that gasoline taxes are a more efficient means to reduce fuel consumption than mandating fuel economy increases.\n\nIncreased vehicle miles traveled due to enhanced fuel economy is another aspect that some studies, such as Dowlatabadi et al. (1996), Bamberger (2002) and Portney et al. (2003), found to be problematic. An increase in VMT also means an increase in congestion and crash costs (CBO, 2003), and an increase in the overall cost of driving (Bamberger, 2002). Nivola and Crandall (1995) argued against the effectiveness of CAFE in reducing vehicle miles traveled and labeled CAFE as a problematic experiment. They argued that the United States would have saved at least as much oil, by reducing miles driven in all types and vintages of vehicles, at about a third the economic cost, if a fee of just 25 cents a gallon had been added to the cost of gasoline nine years ago. Wang (1994) proposed a marketable permit scheme for light duty vehicle manufacturers as a more efficient alternative to the existing CAFE standards. For CAFE to be more effective, Portney et al. (2003) suggested the adoption of tradable fuel economy (FE) permits among manufacturers, revision of the criterion for distinction between cars and light trucks, and removal of distinctions between domestic and imported vehicle fleets.\n\nSeveral studies (Greene, 1991; NRC 2002; Greene and Hopson, 2003) have measured the welfare effects of fuel economy regulations by estimating lifetime fuel saving benefits and subtracting the added vehicle costs from it. Welfare studies widely differ not only in",
      "14": "magnitude but also in the direction of the welfare effect. Kleit (2004) demonstrated that a long-run MPG increase in the CAFE standard not only causes a huge welfare loss but that it is also an inefficient instrument for conserving fuel. He found that a long-run 3.0 MPG increase in the CAFE standard leads to $\\$ 4$ billion of welfare loss per year and 5.2 billion gallons of gasoline savings per year. He shows that the same amount of fuel can be conserved with an increase in the gasoline tax of 11 cents per gallon. The overall welfare loss resulting from such an increase would be $\\$ 290$ million per year or about onefourteenth of the cost imposed in the former case. Dowlatabadi et al. (1996) argued against further increasing CAFE standards. They maintain that fuel savings from increasing CAFE are subjected to diminishing returns. West and Williams (2005) showed that an interaction with the tax-distorted labor market causes the cost advantage of the gas tax over the CAFE standard to be higher than anticipated. In such a context, increasing the gas tax would very likely lead to welfare gain, whereas welfare loss is almost certain if the CAFE standard is tightened.\n\nTable 1 presents the impacts of CAFE standards on fuel savings and job losses. The CAFE standards might be considered successful in enhancing fuel economy but the gains achieved through CAFE standards have been undermined by the growth in vehicle fleet: The policy has not been able to reduce overall fuel demand due to the rapid growth of the vehicle fleet. Gallagher et al. (2007) pointed out the ineffectiveness of CAFE in terms of ensuring energy security. He argued that, although CAFE standards are politically attractive and induce innovation among other things, it might not be the right policy instrument when it comes to ensuring energy security through reduced fuel consumption. Total motor vehicle fuel consumption in the United States has increased by 60 percent since the enactment of the CAFE program. Enhanced fuel economy standards may have propelled more driving - the so-called \"rebound\" effect - increasing the total vehicle miles traveled. Greening et al. (2000), however, argued that the increase in travel resulting from the decrease in cost per mile and reduced fuel intensity arising from the CAFE standards is minimal.",

(2004) argued that welfare gains depend upon myriad factors such as ability of the CAFE to function as a set of internal taxes on fuel inefficient vehicles, subsidies on fuel-efficient vehicles, local pollution, nationwide congestion, traffic accidents, and how consumers value fuel economy technologies and their opportunity costs. CAFE, according to Goldberg (1998), may not fare that badly from a welfare point of view because of its ability to function as a set of internal taxes (on fuel inefficient) and subsidies (on fuel-efficient vehicles) within each firm. Based on the estimates of CAFE's impact on local pollution, nationwide congestion, and traffic accidents, Parry et al.(2004) found that, contingent upon how consumers value fuel economy technologies and their opportunity costs, higher fuel economy standards can produce anything from significant welfare gains, to very little or no effect, to significant welfare losses.

Vehicle Emission Standards \n\nThe implementation of emission standards is the most direct way of reducing emissions per VMT (Walsh, 1992).Without introducing emission standards, policies aimed at reducing fuel consumption and enhancement of fuel economy may not be sufficient to contain local air pollutant from the transport sector (ADB, 2003). Olsson (1994) argued that stringent emission standards lower emissions by forcing the auto industry to derive new vehicle technologies. Emission standards have been introduced in practice in many countries since 1970s. However, levels of emission standards, vehicle coverage, and monitoring and enforcement differ across countries. Here, we briefly discuss a few examples of emission standards introduced in selected countries/states.\n\n### 4.1 Emission Standards in the United States\n\nIn the United States, Congress passed the Clean Air Act in 1970, calling for the first tailpipe emissions standards to control specifically carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). In 1975, the new standards were put into effect with a NOx standard for cars and light duty trucks of 3.1 grams per mile (gpm). In order to make the Act more effective, Congress amended the Act and further tightened emission standards in 1977. The NOx standard, between 1977 and 1979, was reduced from 3.1 gpm to 2.0 gpm for cars. In order to meet the Clean Air Act requirements, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) set the first tailpipe standards for light duty trucks at 1.7 gpm in 1979 and for heavier trucks at 2.3 gpm in 1988. Effective in 1988, the standards for light duty trucks were lowered to 1.2 gpm (USEPA, 1999).",
      "17": "# Tier 1 Emission Standards in the United States \n\nIn 1990, Congress amended the Clean Air Act. Emission standards were further tightened to counter the additional pollution resulting from the increase in vehicle stock. Published as a final rule on June 5, 1991, Tier 1 standards were implemented between 1994 and 1997. Effective in 1994, the NOx standard was set at 0.6 gpm for cars (USEPA, 1999). The Tier 1 vehicle emission standards ( 0.25 grams per mile non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) for light duty vehicles, which were introduced progressively from 1994 onwards in the United States, became obsolete after the 2003 model year with a phase-in implementation of Tier 2 standard schedule from 2004 to 2009 (Gwilliam et al., 2004).\n\n## Tier 2 Emission Standards in the United States\n\nThe EPA proposed Tier 2 tailpipe emissions standards in 1999 that were to be implemented in 2004. For the first time, both cars and light duty trucks were subject to the same national pollution control system. The same emissions standards apply to all vehicle weight categories. For example, cars, minivans, light-duty trucks, and SUVs have the same emission limit. Tier 2 set the new standard at 0.07 gpm for NOx, a 77 to 86 percent reduction for cars. In order to take full advantage of vehicle emission control technologies, the EPA also proposed a reduction in average sulfur levels to 30 parts per million (ppm) (USEPA, 1999) from the then average of more than 300 ppm. As a comprehensive national control program meant to regulate vehicles and their fuel as a single system, the Tier 2 Emission Standards pursue significant emission reductions (Gwilliam et al., 2004). Tier 2 regulations are more stringent than Tier 1 requirements, and they further extend the application of the standards to include some of the heavier vehicle categories that were not included in Tier 1 standards (Dieselnet, 2005).\n\nIn order to understand how the Tier 2 program works, it is necessary to understand the EPA's classification of light duty vehicles and trucks.

The way it works is that, under the \"emission bin\" approach, manufacturers select a set of emission standards (a bin) to comply with, as a result of which test groups are obliged to meet all standards within that particular bin. For example: If a manufacturer aims for Bin 5 for its light duty diesel vehicles and cannot meet the target, the higher bins in that case allow a safety factor. It is the manufacturer's responsibility now to offset the higher bin models with similar volumes of lower bin vehicles (CONCAWE, 2006). In addition, the Tier 2 vehicles are obliged to meet the requirements of one of the available \"emission bin\" and a full life $\\mathrm{NO}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ standard of 0.07 $\\mathrm{g} /$ miles (CONCAWE, 2006).",
      "19": "# California Emission Standards \n\nAmong the states in the U.S., California tends to be the leader in imposing increasingly stringent environmental regulations. In 1989, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), in response to severe air pollution problems in Los Angeles and other major cities in California, established stringent, technology-forcing vehicle emission standards to be phased in between the period of 1994 and 2003 (Faiz et. al., 1996). As California began to regulate vehicle emissions earlier than the Federal government, it is treated differently than the other states when it comes to providing a free hand to adopt its own unique vehicle emissions control program. Under the Clean Air Act in 1970, California is allowed to set its own emissions standards (ECMT, 2000). The LEV II regulations, which were formally adopted on 5 August 1998 and came into operation on 27 November 1999, are the current standards for California (See table $3 \\& 4$ ) (CONCAWE, 2006).\n\nTable 3.

The regulations are similar to established emission standards and test procedures for on-road vehicles in the United States (CONCAWE, 2006).\n\n### 4.3 Vehicle Emission Regulations in Europe\n\nIn Europe, it was the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE) that formulated emission regulations in the 1970s and early 1980s (CONCAWE, 2006). The motor vehicle emission regulations developed by the ECE were then adopted by individual member states (Faiz et al.1996). Although in the early years the European Union (EU) adopted regulations that were almost identical with the ECE equivalents, EU has since become proactive in formulating vehicle emission standards. Under the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, EU member states are legally obliged to follow EU regulations (CONCAWE, 2006). In order to make the existing regulations for light duty",
      "21": "vehicles more stringent, the EU council of Ministers, in March 1994, adopted EU Directives 94/12/EC. The new emission limits were applied starting 1 January 1996 for new models and 1 January 1997 for existing models. Unlike previous regulations, it set separate standards for gasoline and diesel-fueled vehicles (CONCAWE, 2006). Tables 5 and 6 below display the EU's commitment to reducing the transport sector emissions: The EU has, over time, adopted tougher standards for all vehicular pollutants.\n\nTable 5.

      "23": "The European emissions standards have become stricter with the adoption of newer Euro limit values. It has gradually tightened catalyst-forcing standards for new gasoline-fueled cars (also called Euro 1 standards) since its adoption in the early 1990s. It adopted Euro 2, Euro 3, and Euro 4 in 1996, 2000, and 2005 respectively. It also adopted similar requirements for diesel cars and light and heavy commercial vehicles (ADB, 2003). In response to the ongoing planned and probable control measures across the European Union (EU), by the year 2010, vehicular emission in Europe are expected to fall markedly (Reis et al., 2000). The maximum permissible limits set by Euro 3 called for 30 percent reduction of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 80 percent reduction of particulate matter (PM) emissions. Euro 5 regulations, which new models were obliged to meet starting October 1, 2008, and new registrations of vehicle models certified earlier are supposed to meet starting October 1, 2009, are even more stringent. NOx emission limits are further reduced, by 60 percent compared to Euro 3 (Bauner et al., 2008). Because of the voluntary agreement between the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) and the European Commission, the former are obliged to reduce the fuel consumption and average unit emissions of $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ of new private cars, both gasoline and diesel, by 21 percent from the period of 1995 to 2008 (Joumard, 2005).\n\nEmission standards alone will not be able to constrain car usage and associated emissions. With an increase in living standards, consumer preferences do shift considerably. In the EU, while Gross Domestic Product (GDP) witnessed 2.5 percent growth in between 1970 and 1997, annual passenger and freight transport averages increased by an average of 2.8 and 2.6 percent (Walsh, 2000). A gradual shift in consumers' preference towards new low emission car purchases might be able to slow down the rise in emissions level but more cars on roads also means more congestion and emissions. In addition to the enforcement of stringent emission standard, the following measures should be implemented to improve the effectiveness of emissions control policies: (i) measures such as the use of renewable or non-fossil based fuels and alternative technologies such as fuel cells and gasoline-electric hybrid engine; (ii) shift to less energy intensive modes and reductions in travel, (iii) technological improvements in",
      "24": "fuel economy; and, (iv), an increase in load factors (Scholl et. al., 1996; Dargay and Gately, 1997; Kosugia et. al., 2005).\n\n# 4.4 Vehicle Emissions Standards in Latin America \n\nLike other developing countries, Latin American countries have witnessed rapid growth in transport sector emissions. Urban air quality has deteriorated with an increase in the number of vehicles on urban roadways. In Buenos Aires, for example, the transport sector accounts for over 99 percent of CO emissions and 46 percent of the NOx emissions (Venegas and Mazzeo, 2006). The situation in Brazil is quite similar. In 2004, transport sector emissions accounted for 46 percent of total HC and 98 percent of total CO in the Saõ Paulo Metropolitan Area (SPMA) (Vivancoa and Andradeb, 2006). In Santiago, Chile, older cars and diesel-powered vehicles are the main contributors to CO and NOx concentrations. Between 1990 and 2000, they accounted for 65 percent of total urban air emissions (Jorquera, 2002). In Mexico City, the transport sector accounted for 98 percent of total CO emissions, 40 percent of total HC emissions, 81 percent of total NOx emissions (Molina and Molina, 2002).\n\nIn response to rapidly deteriorating urban air quality, Latin American countries have initiated or adopted emission standards. The stringency of the standards, however, varies across countries/cities depending upon the level of air pollution and other factors. As outlined in Table 7, many Latin American countries have imposed complete or partial bans on used vehicles imports. Despite a huge market for used vehicles, countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela have completely banned used vehicle imports (Pelletiere and Reinert, 2002).",

For example in Mexico City, the total daily CO and NOx emissions from light and medium gasoline vehicle in 2000, were 48 percent and 26 percent lower, respectively, from 1998 levels (Schifter et. al., 2005).\n\n# 4.5 Vehicle Emissions Standards in Asia \n\nEmission standards have been widely implemented in Asia. Some Asian countries (e.g., Singapore, Hong Kong) have introduced and strictly enforced stringent emission",
      "27": "standards (Seik, 1996); others are yet to get there. Besides lower standards, strict enforcement is a major challenge in Asia. For example, China's current limit (Euro II), as compared to the United States, is 26 percent higher for carbon monoxide and double for hydrocarbons. However, the proposed Euro II standards have not been met due to weak enforcement (Zhao, 2004).\n\nTable 9 illustrates exhaust emissions regulations in selected Asian countries. Countries such as Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and Singapore have introduced Euro standards, whereas Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Saudi Arabia have implemented U.S. emissions regulations.\n\nIn order to combat deteriorating urban air quality, China has adopted aggressive vehicle emissions standards. It imposed emissions standards equivalent to Euro 1 in 2000 and aims at meeting current European emissions standards, with a lag of about 4-6 years. (Bauner et al., 2008). The existing vehicle emissions standards adopted in Beijing are similar to Euro 2 standards (Deng, 2006). Euro 4 standards will kick in starting 2010 (Liu et al., 2008).\n\nLike mainland China, Taiwan, too, has taken some bold steps towards containing transport sector emissions. The first stage emission standards for gasoline cars were introduced on 1 July 1987. In Taiwan, all passenger cars must pass emission standard tests for CO and HC during the idle phase at $0.5 \\%$ and 100 ppm , respectively, for new cars and $1.2 \\%$ and 220 ppm for in-use cars.

      "29": "Japan is another Asian country that has taken strong measures towards vehicular emission control. In addition to various fiscal instruments, Japan has put in place tough regulatory standards. Its emission standards are clearly on par with standards adopted in Europe and the United States. There are two sets of standards: the first one aimed at reducing pollution from vehicles below 1250 Kg and the second for vehicles weighing more than 1250 Kg . Table 10 illustrates the differences in these two sets of standards. Japan's Central Environmental Council (CEC) published its third report on \"Future policy for motor vehicle exhaust emission reduction\" in December of 1998. It called for a further strengthening of $\\mathrm{NO}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ and PM limits for diesel engines in two stages and led to 25-30 percent reduction in $\\mathrm{NO}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ emission and 28-35 percent reduction in PM emission from 2002-2004, depending on vehicle category.

Fuel Quality Standards \n\nFuel quality standards play a crucial role in protecting public health and the environment from transport sector emissions. It is often viewed as an important component of an overall plan to improve air quality. Cleaner fuels have an immediate impact on both new and existing vehicle fleets. There is a close relationship between fuel quality and",
      "30": "emission control technologies, and it is also important for the successful adoption of stringent vehicle emission standards. The reduction of sulfur to near-zero levels is prerequisite for any air pollution reduction strategy to bear fruits (Hao et al., 2006; Blumberg et al., 2003).\n\nRealizing the importance of cleaner fuel, countries started reducing the level of lead and sulfur in fuel in early the 1990s. Starting January 1995, leaded gasoline sales were banned in the United States. The maximum amount of lead permitted in unleaded gasoline in the United States is 0.013 grams/liter (CONCAWE, 2006). The Alliance of Auto Manufacturers, which represents the auto industry, supported a gasoline sulfur control program in 2004 and agreed to reduce sulfur content to \"near-zero\" levels (less than $5 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg}$ ) by 2007 (CONCAWE, 2006). Similarly, leaded gasoline was banned in the EU effective from 1 January 2000, although some countries like Greece, Italy, and Spain had to be granted a grace period (Gwilliam et al., 2004). EU Directives 2003/17/EC introduced a new sulfur requirement for both gasoline and diesel with a maximum 10 $\\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg}$. It also called for the complete penetration of gasoline and diesel fuels with a maximum $10 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg}$ sulfur contents from 1 January 2009 (CONCAWE, 2006).\n\nTable 11 illustrates specifications for unleaded gasoline in selected developing countries. Fuel quality regulations and specifications vary from one country to another. In countries like Mexico, the maximum allowable limit of sulfur in fuel is far lower than in countries such as Pakistan, India, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Malaysia, and Tanzania. In sub-Saharan Africa, lead was banned on 1 January 2006; the maximum allowable limit is $13 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{l}$ (CONCAWE, 2006). Sulfur limits, especially in diesel, tend to be very high in Pakistan, Malaysia, India, Bangladesh, Thailand, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua.",

By 1998, the local government in Beijing successfully phased out leaded gasoline. At present, sulfur content ranges from 300 ppm to 500 ppm for gasoline and from 500 ppm to 800 ppm for diesel fuel in Beijing (Hao et. al., 2006). Since eliminating lead as an octane booster in gasoline is a relatively low cost measure with high returns in terms of public health, Gwalliam et al. (2004) suggested that it should be a high priority for all countries that have not yet eliminated lead from gasoline.\n\nThe emissions of sulfur dioxide from diesel used in heavy vehicles are one of the main environmental concerns in most countries around the world. Hence, these countries have imposed standards on the sulfur content of diesel. Table 12 presents existing or planned standards for the sulfur content of diesel in selected countries. As can be seen from the",
      "32": "table, sulfur standards for diesel have been rapidly stiffened in many countries over the last decade. For example, the standards in the United States, Japan and European Union have been reduced to 50 ppm in 2005 from 500 ppm in 1996. In Australia, the standards have been reduced to 50 ppm in 2006 from 2000 ppm in 1996. The standards stiffened further to 10 ppm in Japan and European Union. In some developing countries, such as, India, Philippines, Vietnam, the standards for diesel sulfur content were reduced by 10 times during the 1996-2005 period.\n\nAlthough the costs and benefits associated with sulfur reduction vary from region to region, depending on the state of existing refineries, fuel quality, and emissions standards, the cost of sulfur reduction is affordable (Blumberg et. al., 2003). Some countries that import petroleum products might find it hard to maintain the required quality due to the lack of their own refineries. Consequently, developing countries without their own refineries may not be in a position to enforce fuel standard related regulations. Nepal, for example, lacking its own refinery, is dependent on imported petroleum products and is experiencing severe air pollution problems related to the high levels of benzene in imported gasoline (Kiuru, 2002).\n\nAnother important standard imposed on fuels in many countries is the minimum blending requirement of gasoline and diesel with ethanol and bio-diesel, respectively. Although energy security could be the primary purpose of such blending, reducing environmental externalities, particularly $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, is an equally important benefit. Table 13 presents examples of biofuels blending regulations in selected industrialized and developing countries. Most of these regulations were enacted quite recently, and they typically call for the blending of 10-15 percent ethanol with gasoline or the blending of 2-5 percent biodiesel with diesel. The provinces of British Columbia and Quebec in Canada have also announced that they would mandate ethanol blending but exact blending percentages are yet to be stipulated. Brazil has mandated the blending of biofuels for 30 years through its \"ProAlcool\" program; while the blending shares for ethanol were adjusted occasionally, they have remained in the 20-25 percent range.",

Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Programs \n\nInspection and maintenance (I/M) programs are largely devised to identify primary \"gross polluters\" and ensure that they are retrofitted or retired. Be it developed or developing countries, vehicles that are not properly maintained are responsible for a large fraction of total transport sector emissions. Based on a cross country study of CO and HC",
      "35": "emissions from over 200,000 vehicles in the USA, Canada, Mexico, the UK, and Sweden, Guenther et al. (1994) found that less than 10 percent of the fleet, which are referred to as \"gross polluters,\" are responsible for half of the total emissions. Likewise, around 10-12 percent of the existing vehicle fleet accounted for about 50 percent of transport sector CO emissions in Nepal from 2001-2002 (Faiz et al., 2006). Therefore, the problem of a small percentage of ill-maintained vehicles diluting the gains made through higher fuel, emissions, and fuel economy standards is not a developed or developing countries' problem; it is a global problem that calls for innovative ways to discourage \"gross polluters\" from getting on the roadways.\n\nAlthough I/M programs have been widely implemented in both the developed and developing word, there is no universal consensus on the use of I/M programs to regulate vehicle emissions. Faiz et al. (1990) and Mage and Walsh (1992) emphasized the importance of I/M programs. According to Faiz et al. (1990), without a rigorous I/M program, smoke and particulate emissions from often overloaded and poorly maintained diesel-powered vehicles cannot be controlled in developing countries. Mage and Walsh (1992) argued that I/M programs are critical for controlling emissions from both new car and in-use vehicles. Gwalliam (2004) and Kebin and Chang (1999), based on experiences from Mexico City and China, considered I/M programs a success. The I/M system introduced in Mexico city with high volume, centralized test centers is an example of a successful program on a large scale (Gwalliam, 2004). In Beijing, according to Kebin and Chang, (1999), emissions decreased a total of 28 to 40 percent, and in Shanghai, CO and HC emission concentrations decreased on average by 39 percent. Like in Beijing, the I/M program introduced in 1992 in the Lower Fraser Valley of the Canadian province of British Columbia, led to reduction in HC emissions by 20 percent, CO by 20 percent, and $\\mathrm{NO}_{\\mathrm{x}}$ by 1 percent (Faiz et al., 1996). Contrary to the aforementioned studies, Hubbard (1997) argued that the existing I/M programs in the United States have generated, at most, small environmental benefits.\n\nDespite some criticisms, I/M programs have been widely implemented. In the United States, California was the first the state that implemented a wide-ranging test and repair",
      "36": "I/M program in 1984. It required gasoline-powered automobiles to pass inspections every two years (Faiz et al., 1996). In other states, depending upon the state's performance standards, motorists have to satisfy I/M requirements (Harrington et al., 2000).\n\nWithin the European Union, the member states have implemented the requirements of the Roadworthiness Framework Directive. It requires vehicle owners to go for a compulsory vehicle inspection and is enforced to ensure the necessary maintenance and upkeep of vehicles (CCAP, 2004). EU Directive 96/96/EC regulates I/M programs and safety inspections. The directive also provides some leeway to the member states in terms of: (i) setting a higher frequency of tests; (ii) making the testing of optional equipment compulsory; (iii) expanding test requirements to other classes of vehicles; and, (iv) prescribing additional or more stringent tests (USAID, 2004).\n\nIn Australia, a pilot I/M scheme was introduced in July 1998 in the greater Sydney area. Its main aim was to include all light duty vehicle by the year 2000. The main goal of the National In-service Emissions (NISE2) study was to establish a primary phase and a main phase testing that would aid in the establishment of the current emissions performance of light duty petrol vehicles (CONCAWE, 2006). The primary phase was designed to develop and validate reliable emission tests for light duty gasoline vehicles that are based on \"real world\" driving patterns. It was intended to provide the basic tools for use in the main phase for generating a more accurate and representative measure of the actual amount of pollutants emitted from the light duty gasoline fleet (CONCAWE, 2006).\n\nChina's I/M programs require regular inspections, which include yearly inspections, firstclass maintenance, second class maintenance, and vehicle overhaul. In big cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, I/M programs have been effective, to a large degree, in lowering vehicle emissions (Kebin and Chang, 1999).\n\nDespite their emission reduction potential, I/M programs have certain limitations, which are primarily on two fronts: (i) inefficient use of resources and inconvenience to motorists; and, (ii) infectiveness in identifying gross polluting vehicles (Calvert et al.,",
      "37": "1993; Bishop et al., 1997). Lack of proper enforcement, and corruption, prevents the realization of the full potential of any I/M program. Moreover, the lack of capacity, such as the lack of training of personnel, and poor quality test equipment, can hinder the success of the program. India is a classic example of how the lack of a well-conceived program defeats the overall objectives of the program [USAID, 2004] ${ }^{2}$. In Nepal, between 16-32 percent of vehicles failed the emissions test from 2000-2002 (Faiz et al., 2006). In Chongqing, China, only 10 percent of vehicles brought in by drivers failed the emissions test, but 40 percent of vehicles flagged down by roadside inspectors did not pass the emission test (USAID, 2004).\n\n# 7. Other Laws and Regulations \n\nAlthough policies such as fuel economy standards, emission standards, fuel quality standards, and I/M programs are most frequently utilized, they are by no means the only regulatory instruments introduced to discourage travel demand and reduce emissions from the transport sector. Several other regulatory measures have been experimented with, to varying degrees of success. For example, access bans, or partial and total vehicle bans, have been widely used in European countries such as Italy, Greece, The Netherlands, Spain, and Germany (Goddard, 1997). Italy has adopted a policy that bans private cars from entering the city centers. Italy aims to protect its historical city centers by not allowing non-residents to drive into the city center. In Swiss cities such as Bern and Zurich, the restrictive measures taken by the government (e.g., limited parking, road capacity reduction and diversion of through traffic) has made driving so difficult that many Swiss prefer using public transport (Bonnel, 1995).\n\nThe \"No- Driving Day\" (NDD) (or Hoy No Circula) policy introduced in Mexico City in 1989 is one of the much-discussed regulatory measures to control traffic congestion and vehicular emissions. It would not only help reduce environmental externalities through travel management but also reduce traffic congestion (Molina and Molina, 2004). The\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Indian I/M programs are plagued by poor quality personnel and test equipment, low compliance rates, and corruption. I/M tests are not taken by more than 15 percent of drivers and those who take it pass without truly controlling their emissions (USAID, 2004).",
      "38": "program mandates not driving one day during the week (except the weekends) and two days during serious pollution episodes. During the weekends, odd and even license plate numbers are used, which forced one-half of the fleet to be parked. By removing 20 percent of the vehicles from the streets in its first few months of operation, it did contribute towards the betterment of ambient air quality (Goddard, 1997). The gains made, however, were temporary. The program did not yield the desired level of success for several reasons. First, the city lacked sufficient public transport systems to meet the travel demand resulting from the ban on personal vehicles. Second, the driving public intelligently subverted the existing regulation. For example, many drivers adjusted to the restriction by purchasing additional autos in order to have at least one vehicle available on any given day. Many of the second vehicles were older and released more emissions. Some studies (e.g., Eskeland, 1994; Eskeland and Feyzioglu, 1995; Goddard, 1997) even argued that the program actually may have led to an increase in the number of vehicles and total emissions from road transport.\n\nIn addition to Mexico City, the traffic restriction (restricción vehicular) policy has been implemented in three different Latin American cities: Santiago (Chile), São Paulo (Brazil), and Bogotá (Colombia), with varying degree of success. The traffic restriction policy in Santiago implemented to reduce congestion and air pollution has limited the circulation of $20 \\%$ of buses, taxis, and cars. In order to combat free rider problem, the schedule for the restriction is changed every few months. In São Paulo, the effects of the traffic ban have been undermined by growing car ownership. In order to meet air quality targets, Mexico City authorities are planning modifications to the existing scheme to ensure stricter enforcement with fewer exemptions (Mahendra, 2007).\n\nMany Latin American countries have imposed complete or partial bans on used vehicles imports. Despite a huge market for used vehicles, countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela have completely banned used vehicle imports (Pelletiere and Reinert, 2002).",
      "39": "The Supreme Court of India has played a proactive role in controlling vehicular pollution in New Delhi. Its directives include: (i) the phasing out of commercial/transport vehicles older than 15 years; (ii) the replacement of all pre-1990 autos and taxis with new vehicles using clean fuel; and, (iii) the conversion of the entire city bus fleet, both public and private, to use compressed natural gas (CNG) (DOT, 2009). The Supreme Court order for the conversion of the entire diesel-powered bus fleet in Delhi and its successful implementation clearly shows that the reluctance on the part of the government in developing countries in maintaining air quality can be overcome through the judicial system.\n\nIn many large U.S. cities, regulation such as high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes are introduced. These regulations help reduce emissions in two ways: (i) encouraging an increased vehicle occupancy and (ii) encouraging the use of clean vehicles (hybrids) and vehicles with higher fuel efficiency (motor cycles) as such vehicles are allowed in HOV and HOT lanes. Until recently, ten US States have considered allowing single occupant hybrid vehicles (SOHV) into HOV lanes (Chu et al., 2007). Although well intentioned, allowing hybrid vehicles in HOV lanes have started to produce negative externality in the form of increased congestion in HOV lanes. For example in Virginia, USA, where motorcycles and hybrid vehicles are allowed to ply on HOV facilities statewide, traffic congestion problem has been increasing experienced by the commuters. In a survey conducted in 2002, vanpoolers cited Congestion in HOV lanes as their second greatest concern, which has been increased in recent years by the influx of hybrid vehicles into the Virginia HOV lanes (Poole and Balaker, 2005). Increased congestion also means increase in pollution.\n\n# 8. Which Regulatory Instruments and Where? \n\nThe literature on the design of regulatory policies to reduce transport sector externalities mainly focus on two central questions: (i) the desired level of protection of public health and environmental quality that a country or region is aiming to achieve and (ii) the cost and institutional capacity to implement the policies. Based on intent of the program(s),",
      "40": "easing congestion or controlling pollution, the appropriateness of the regulatory instrument(s) under consideration may vary considerably. Factors that influence the effectiveness of the instrument should be used to gauge the appropriateness of the regulatory measure (Ghose, 2002; Satyanarayana, 2007). The selection of an instrument does not guarantee its effectiveness. The success of the selected instrument relies on factors such as: (i) the overall costs of emission control; (ii) the comprehensiveness of the law/regulations with regard to the level of development of the society; (iii) the ability of the industry in question to bear the control cost burden; and, (iv) the punitive measures in place and the chances of detection of violation (Priyadarshini and Gupta, 2003).\n\nThe choice of control options is based on the country's priorities, the characteristics of the air pollution problem and the resources of the regulating agency (Cohen and Kamieniecki, 1991; Faiz and Larderel, 1993). Take countries or cities facing severe local air pollution problems, for example. Most developing countries normally introduce emissions standards, whereas developed countries, which are equally concerned with local air pollution, adopt a myriad of regulatory measures, such as fuel economy and fuel standards, in addition to emission standards. Regulatory standards vary considerably from one country to another depending upon the level of motorization, dependency on private vehicles, and environmental consciousness. Fuel economy standards across European countries and between the United States and the EU vary significantly. Most developing countries are found to be reluctant to introduce stringent regulatory standards because of their limited resources to enforce the stringent standards (Cohen and Kamienicki, 1991; Priyadarshini and Gupta, 2003; Delfin, 2004).\n\nNote here that regulatory standards are not mutually exclusive to each other in that introduction of an instrument does not require others. For example, emission standards are necessary to control local air pollutants such as $\\mathrm{CO}, \\mathrm{HC}, \\mathrm{NOx}$, and fine particulate matter. Control devices reducing these emissions do not necessarily reduce fuel consumption and $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions and, hence, emission standards do not replace fuel economy standards. Similarly, emission standards may not replace fuel quality standards.",
      "41": "As the level of air pollution varies from one city to another, depending upon the level of motorization, compactness of the city, and maintenance level of the existing vehicle stock, most developing countries are struggling to make the selection of appropriate regulatory instruments that can effectively reduce emissions from the transport sector. One of the major questions, whose answer seems elusive for most, is what is the starting point in terms of framing effective policy instruments in reducing transport sector emissions? There seems to be no clear-cut answer to this question. There are, however, several worthy suggestions (Gwalliam, 2004; Mage and Walsh, 1992; ADB, 2003; Blumberg et al., 2003).\n\nUnderstanding the factors affecting the total inventory of motor vehicle emissions is necessary to design effective programs. The $\\operatorname{ADB}(2003)$ suggested that countries with a serious air pollution problem strongly consider leapfrogging to the most stringent standards possible, such as the Euro 2, Euro 3 or Euro 4, after making sure that the appropriate fuel is available. Blumberg et al. (2003) argued that jumping to near-zero sulfur diesel in a single step is more cost-effective and advantageous. The suggestions, although genuine, may not be always feasible due to the lack of resources, trained labor, and the required infrastructure. For example, one of the major difficulties associated with vehicle emission control programs is that it imposes significant economic and social costs (Gwalliam, 2004) and the actual beneficiaries are hard to identify (Faiz et al., 1999).\n\nMotor vehicle pollution control programs should be based on a realistic assessment of costs and benefits and must be compared with the technical and administrative feasibility of proposed countermeasures. In order to make services affordable to the poor, transport policy must be designed to be both environmentally sensitive and consistent with public and private affordability.\n\n# 9. Conclusions \n\nThis study reviews the main regulatory policy instruments to control transport sector externalities. The instruments considered include fuel economy standards, emission",
      "42": "standards, fuel quality standards and other laws and regulations. We also highlight factors affecting the selection of regulatory instruments.\n\nFuel economy standards have generally been introduced in developed countries, which are not only concerned about local air pollutions but also other factors such as traffic congestion, climate change, and energy security. In the United States, fuel economy standards were first introduced in the early 1970s in an effort to lessen the impacts of the first oil crisis. Currently, the policy also serves to reduce GHG emissions. The fuel economy standard in the U.S. has not improved, however, since the 1985 level of 27.5 MPG, although the 2007 Energy Bill mandates an improvement to 35 MPG by 2020. In contrast to United States, the EU has defined fuel economy in terms of GHG emissions due to the increasing contribution of urban transportation to global GHG emissions. Implementation of the EU fuel economy standards will result in the reduction of vehicular $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emission from $186 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{km}$ in 1995 to $140 \\mathrm{~g} / \\mathrm{km}$ in 2008 and further to 120 $\\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{km}$ by 2012 .\n\nAlthough the fuel economy standard is one of the key regulatory instruments employed in industrialized countries to reduce transport sector externalities, its success has been contested. Some existing literature argue that equivalent fiscal policy instruments, such as fuel or emission taxes, could have produced better results than fuel economy standards while reducing the same amount of fuel consumption and emissions. While the fuel economy standards help reduce fuel consumption and associated emissions, particularly $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ emissions, they do not necessarily reduce local and regional air pollutants, such as CO, VOC, NOx, and SPM to the level necessary to meet local air quality standards in many cities around the world.\n\nEmission standards have been introduced in both industrialized and developing countries to control local air pollution. In response to the increase in local pollution level, vehicle emission standards have consistently been tightened over the years. Starting in 2004, tailpipe emissions standard for NOx has been set at 0.07 grams per mile in the U.S. (compare to 3.1 grams per mile in 1975). In the EU, there have been quick revisions in",
      "43": "the emission standards towards advance standards. The Euro 1 standards introduced in the early 1990s were modified to Euro 2 in 1996, to Euro 3 in 2000 and finally to Euro 4 in 2005. Following the footsteps of the industrialized countries, developing countries, too, have made commendable progress in terms of adopting emission standards. Several countries in Latin America and Asia have adopted either Euro or U.S. emission standards to control their local air pollution.\n\nIn order to control some pollutants, such as lead and oxides of sulfur, the element causing these pollutants needs to be limited through fuel quality standards. Most countries around the world have phased out leaded gasoline and controlled lead content in unleaded gasoline. Similarly, many countries, both industrialized and developing, have introduced fuel quality standards to limit sulfur content, thereby reducing oxides of sulfur and particulate matter. Moreover, several countries have introduced mandates for blending ethanol and biodiesel into respectively, gasoline and diesel. This would certainly help reduce $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and some local air pollutants.\n\nSetting vehicular standards does not necessarily control emissions unless an effective enforcement mechanism is in place, however. Inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs are the most common initiatives countries have undertaken to enforce the standards. The programs mandate regular inspection of vehicles and retirement of those not meeting the standards. Besides standards, there also exist some regulatory measures, such as imports ban of polluting vehicles in many Latin American countries, partial and complete driving restrictions in some European cities and the no driving day program in Mexico City and the mandatory conversion of public bus in New Delhi from diesel to compressed natural gas (CNG).\n\nFuel economy standards, emission standards, fuel quality standards and I/M programs are not mutually exclusive and they are introduced for different purposes. Different countries could give priority to different measures depending upon their needs and institutional capacity to enforce the standards. Since most developing countries are particularly",
      "44": "concerned about local air pollution, they are found to prioritize the introduction of emissions standards and fuel quality standards over fuel economy standards.\n\n# References \n\nAhrens, G-A.
